  enhances:
    - technique: "Callback"
      strength: 0.8
      description: "Misdirection can make callbacks more surprising"
      example: >
        Setup references earlier joke seemingly straight,
        then misdirects to new punchline
    
    - technique: "Act Out"
      strength: 0.7
      description: "Physical misdirection can enhance verbal misdirection"
      example: >
        Body language suggests one direction while
        punchline goes another
  
  enhanced_by:
    - technique: "Timing"
      strength: 0.9
      description: "Proper pause before misdirection increases impact"
      notes: "Optimal pause length: 0.5-1.5 seconds"
    
    - technique: "Setup Building"
      strength: 0.8
      description: "Strong setup makes misdirection more effective"
      notes: "Clearer expectation = stronger surprise"

  conflicts_with:
    - technique: "Anti-humor"
      severity: 0.6
      description: "Anti-humor often removes logical connection"
      resolution: "Choose one approach or clearly separate"
    
    - technique: "One-liners"
      severity: 0.4
      description: "One-liners often too brief for proper misdirection"
      resolution: "Can work if setup is very efficient"

  common_combinations:
    - name: "Misdirection + Callback + Act Out"
      effectiveness: 0.9
      example: >
        Reference earlier joke, act out expected direction,
        then verbally misdirect to new punchline
    
    - name: "Misdirection + Character Work"
      effectiveness: 0.8
      example: >
        Establish character expectation, then break
        character in surprising but logical way

sequence_effects:
  before:
    - technique: "Callback"
      reason: "Provides material to call back to"
    
    - technique: "Character Break"
      reason: "Establishes character to subvert"
  
  after:
    - technique: "Tag"
      reason: "Can build on misdirection's surprise"
    
    - technique: "Act Out"
      reason: "Can physically emphasize the twist"

training_progression:
  1: "Simple verbal misdirection"
  2: "Adding physical elements"
  3: "Combining with callbacks"
  4: "Complex multi-level misdirection"
  5: "Integrating with character work"

notes:
  - "Start with clear, simple misdirection before attempting combinations"
  - "Always maintain logical connection even in complex combinations"
  - "Use related techniques to enhance but not overshadow misdirection"
  - "Consider audience's cognitive load when combining techniques"
