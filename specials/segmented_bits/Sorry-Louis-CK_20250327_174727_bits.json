Even if there's a one in a million chance I get caught burning little girls panties  So I'm wearing them right now  It's the only solution I could come up with  I wear them every day  And I hand wash them  And I dry them like this  Just right on the little strawberries  Here's the thing, men, our biggest fear in life is that we're going to get caught being a kid fucker  That's every guy's biggest fear  It's like being afraid of sharks when you live in the desert  Because it's a fear not based in its likelihood but in how horrible it would be if it happened  Because when they catch a pedophile, holy fuck  Holy shit  It's brutal because we're scared  We're so scared of pedophilia because it's here and it's not going anywhere  That's a fact  It's not like there's a finite amount of pedophiles and we got the last one  No, it keeps happening  Every generation there's more  Some of you have kids and some of them are going to grow up and fuck kids  They might, you know  Not a great thought, I understand, it's not an uplifting  You wouldn't put that on a fridge magnet or on your screen saver at the office  There will always be pedophiles  Hey, where's Jim? He's not at his desk  We do, we have to start with that reality because our solutions that we have so far don't really work  Here's our current solution to pedophilia  We wait until somebody fucks about 10,000 kids and then we go, all right, you better cut that out  That's pretty much it  There's no measures for preventing it, none  We have no policy to prevent pedophilia  No hunting, no spitting, no skateboarding  I mean, try it  But even if one out of a 50 of them is like, oh shit, I am sorry, I didn't know it was an issue  That's money well spent  There's things that might work and we don't even try them  Like, is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls?  Oh no  That would be distasteful  The thing is that this, I'm still talking about it, this problem  Lose things because we won't really face it, you know  That are important to us, like the Boy Scouts  Boy Scouts, wonderful thing  Being sued out of existence because of all the kid fuckery that goes on  And I know it's upsetting  Because look, here's the thing, the Boy Scouts is a wonderful thing for kids  They go to the woods, they work together, they learn skills  They get in touch with nature  What could it be better for a boy than that?  But some of those guys want to fuck the kids  I don't think they do it a lot  I think it's mostly that they find out that the guy wants to  I don't actually know though  How many Boy Scouts get fucked on a...  Every time I move I gotta tell my neighbors that I looked that up  Here's what happens, every few years you find out there's some pedophile type people in the Boy Scouts  We're good  And then a year later, well there's a bunch more  What's going on here?  At some point you gotta wake up to the basic fact  Are folks that want to fuck them  Maybe that's, if you want that, that's where you go  You don't want to take them  Why? They're good at it, that's what makes them good at it  I'm not saying that all Scout Masters are pedophiles  I might be saying that the best ones are  That sounds right  You have to lose the whole thing  Just tell your kids, some of those guys want to fuck you  Just be careful  Have a good time  Take the contribution from where it comes  Michael Jackson, wonderful music  Blessed us with wonderful music  Did some other things too  What, look, what's worse?

What is it?  What is this?  Why can't either of us  See our families?  Why?  What the fuck is the point of this?  So yeah  I got my dog  My kids  I just sit around  I watch YouTube a lot  That's my favorite pastime  I was watching YouTube today  I was watching one of the ads  That comes on before the video  I watch  I don't skip those  I think that's rude  It is  It's mean  Somebody worked hard on that ad  They trained a cheetah  To run alongside a Jeep Cherokee  And you're at home like  Three, two, one, fuck off  It's fucking mean  What if you made something, dick?  The ad was a PSA  It was an anti-smoking message  It was a Puerto Rican man  With a hole in his throat  He was like  My father smoked  And my mother smoked  Please don't smoke cigarettes  First thought I had was  It's coming out  It feels like if you bypass the mouth  You shouldn't have an accent anymore  Is that just how air sounds coming out of this guy?  Does he fart with an accent?  Anyway, after the ad  I watched the video that I was looking for  Which was a scene from a movie  And it's a scene that I really hate  Every time I see it, it makes me angry  Which is why I was looking for it on YouTube  And it's a movie I like  I actually like the movie  It's called Good Will Hunting  Remember Good Will Hunting?  Of course, right?  Matt Damon  Great performance  He plays a very complicated young man  Wearing a tight t-shirt for a whole movie  And here's my issue with Good Will Hunting  Matt Damon also wrote the movie, okay?  So he basically sat down and he's like  First of all, I'm amazing  I'm a construction worker  I'm like, working class  And I drink beer and I get in fights  I get in so many fights  My friends are like, you're out of control, man  And I'm like, shut up  This is the way I am  But then also  I'm a genius  Ooh  I didn't even go to school  I just know things  I don't know why  I just know them  And all the nerdy geniuses that studied for years are like  It's making us upset  It's insane  It's insane  It's fucking insane  It only makes sense if he wrote it for himself to be the guy  It's the worst example of that in the movie  Here's what happens  He goes to a bar and he meets a woman  And he likes her  And another guy likes her too  But she picks Matt Damon  Because he wrote the fucking movie  She doesn't like him  You better believe it  So he gets her phone number  And then he goes outside  And he sees the other guy  In the window of a restaurant  And he decides to taunt him  So he goes over  He tells his friends  Hey, come here  Watch this  And he says to the guy  Hey  Do you like apples?  And the guy says yes  And Matt Damon goes  Well, I got a number  How do you like them apples?  And all Matt Damon's friends go  Oh  Oh  You know how he did it?  On the guy liking apples  The guy must like apples  Who would say yes  To do you like apples?  Do you like  Wait guys  Watch this  God damn it  I do  I wish I didn't  Because I can tell  This is not going to go my way  But I just  I can't lie  He'll know it  He'll know it  Because boy  Do I like apples  Do you understand?  If he says no  Matt Damon is fucked  He's fucked in the face for life  He's got nothing  No  Dude  Fucking guy  No come on seriously  Seriously  You fucking  Don't fucking  Don't fucking  Do you  Do you like bananas?  Do you  Because I thought  Because the woman gave me her telephone number  And isn't that bananas?  I saw a guy  I saw a guy peeling a banana the other day  That's another banana joke  Did you hear the other one  That ended with banana?  Banana  I got three banana jokes by the way  This is number two  Okay  I saw a guy peeling a banana on Sixth Avenue  And it bothered me  And I'll tell you why  Because it's the way he peels  When I peel a banana  I hold it around here  I peel down to my hand  Right?  This guy holds the banana at the bottom  All the way down  It felt like a guy at a urinal  I was like dude  TMI with that banana right now  What are you making a smoothie on Sixth Avenue  What are you doing?  The banana was like  Hey  You don't even know how much you're going to eat  I have a bruise right here  I kind of got lost in the banana shame there  You want to hear the other banana one now?  Okay  So  I was at the grocery store  And I needed bananas  So  I go over to where the bananas are  And there's a black woman at the bananas  It's going to be okay  It's going to be okay I swear  I understand  White people are very scared  Of discussing bananas and black people  In the same conversation  I understand  If I have a black friend over  I would never offer him a banana  I just don't know why  I just wouldn't do it  Hey you want a banana?  Why the fuck you asking me  Hey man sorry  Have an apple  I'm really sorry  These are just the facts of the case  Alright  I was in the store  Looking for bananas  And there was a black woman at the bananas  And I wanted  I didn't want to go there  While she's there  Because of COVID  We're all giving each other space  So I  But I do want to be next  So I'm waiting  And she's kind of taking a long time  And the longer she takes  The longer I am a white man  Watching a black woman choose bananas  And this is an awful thing  About the world today  Because I know I'm not doing  Anything wrong  But I feel fucking bad  I feel fucking bad  So I went to the strawberries  And there's a fucking Jew  That's the Jew  I'm not going to do the black woman  No I'm not  You know why?  Because I'm not afraid of Jews  That's really  I'm not scared of Jews  I don't find Jews to be frightening  Unless you're in Palestine  Then they're terrifying  Very different  Over there they're like  The Jews are killing us  And here we're like  Really? The Jews?  We've been slapping them around  For years  This banana's too hard  Until two days old  I'm going to buy the hard one  And wait  Just trying to be fair  Just trying to be fair  To the Jews  Lord have mercy",

        "bit_text": " Don't worry  I'm an old man  I'll be gone very soon  I worry about getting old  Only because I don't want  To lose my memory  You know  I mean some of it  I would love to lose  But it doesn't work that way  You got to take it all or none  I guess  But I lose  I forget things  You know  Like remember Fonzie  From Happy Days  I don't remember him  I don't even know  What you're talking about  I forget weird things  You know  Like I was walking  Down the street once  In New York  And there was a guy in a van  And he rolled down the window  And he said  Hey  Get in the van  And suck my dick  And I said  Alright  You know  So  I got in the van  And you know  I was trying to pull the door  The sliding door  But it kept  And he's like  It just shuts  Don't  You don't have to  I was like  Sorry  He's like  Everybody does that  It's okay  So I'm kneeling on the floor  Of the van  On like a purse  And there's no lady in there  But I'm like  I came here to suck  This guy's dick  Not like take inventory  Just in case it works  So I start sucking his dick  And about  Halfway through  I'm guessing  I remembered  That I don't really like doing that  Senior moment  Some people worry about getting old  Because they think it means  That they're dying  Which it does  But this doesn't worry me  I don't worry about dying  Because I think it's necessary  I think it's something  That you just have to do  You should do it  When it's your turn  You should do it  If somebody  You know your doctor says  You're dying  Just say okay  And die  Don't you know  Maybe a miracle  Fuck you  Get in the ground  Just take your turn  I really think that way now  I didn't used to  But I do  Because I  You know when I started  Thinking that way  Was when my mom died  My mom died  A couple years ago  Of anorexia  She was  300 pounds  She was bad at it  I know it was fucked up  Right  What a piece of shit  Anyway  She would have liked that joke  She would have  My mom was fucking  She was gross  And I remember  When she was dying  I was alone with her  And the nurse said  This is imminent  I was like  What does that mean  She goes  She's going to die  In a minute  Like  Just say  In a minute  It's so close  Anyway  I was alone with her  And she died  And I was like  Fuck they're going to think  I did it  Obviously  I didn't want to lose my mom  I really didn't  But we had this one conversation  Like two weeks before  She died  When we were talking about it  And I said  Mom I don't want you to die  And she said  You'll get over it  That's what she said  And I did  In the moment  I wasn't willing to accept it  I was like  I don't want you to go  She said  But we're going in order  Do you understand  This makes sense  I'm your mother  I'm like  Mom stop talking like that  This is sad  She goes  No it's not  Look at it this way  Do you want me to never die  I was like  No I don't want that at all  With an important idea  Which is that  Dying is important  It's every generation's  The greatest contribution  To history  It's the only thing  That keeps things moving  It's the only reason  There's any progress  In the human race  Is that folks  Keep fucking dying  Every generation has had a mix  Of douche bags  And amazing people  And boring  Great  Good  Whatever  But they're all fucking dead  Every fucking one of them  Thank god  They're all fucking dead  There's a limit  To how much  Any of the good ones did  And the shitty ones  Got to stop being shitty  It's a great system  Now when you look  At the internet  And all these people  You're like  What the fuck is happening  It's okay  They're all going  Every one of them  I mean  You don't want to die  You don't want to die  You don't want your loved ones  To die  But that's a selfish wish  When you think about  What would happen  If nobody died  What kind of world would this be  If there was no dead  Nobody  If we still had people here  From the 1100s  It's hard enough  Having people here  From the 50s  Just sorry  Just scan the code  On the table  There's no menu  Jesus Christ  You want to go through that  You want to go through that  With Punch's pilot  And Charlamagne  Fucking pain in the ass  Fucking old people  That don't want to fucking  Just  When you get older  When you get older  And you start going  No it's fine  Just get the fuck out  It's great  They're not gonna make  It work for you  You're here for 10 more minutes  Just get the fuck out  If you're in an airport  And you're looking at the toilet  And you're like  I don't understand  How this works  It's time for you to die  Get the fuck out  That's the way I look at my life now  I had some good  I had some bad  But I'm done  I mean I'll hang around  Because I'm curious  But I'm so interested  In the way things are going  I really am  It's such an interesting time  Such a  We're on a hinge  Such a cool thing  To experience that  I'm excited  About a lot of what's coming  There's things that are hard now  But that's the way it is  Things are gonna get  I think it's exciting  What's happening  I think young people today  Have some great ideas  They're being a little  Cunty about some of them  The ideas are good  Like when I was growing up  We had two genders  Male and female  Now you have all these  Expansion teams  I think it's very exciting  It is  And the best idea  Is this gender fluid thing  This is a great fucking idea  Gender fluid  The idea  The way I barely understand it  Is that  You just  Something in the middle  It's like a fretless base  You don't have to be  The specific pictures  What a dumb way to do it  These are the kinds of people  You can be  Which one are you?  I don't feel like  Any of those people  Then you're a failure  You have to fight  Start acting like these people  So we know what to call you  Why?  Just make it  It's just a  Just  A la carte  I like dicks  I don't like balls  I'm a  This and that  Moving through it  Changing  I wish  What I'm saying is  I wish we had that  When I was a kid  Because I think  Our generation got hurt  By the rigidity  Of identities  And how you had to  Just stick to them  You had to pick one  Right away  You're eight years old  What are you?  I'm a boy  What do you like?  Girls  Vaginas  Love vaginas  I'm eight years old  I never saw one  But I'm  Committing my life  To them right now  I don't even get to  Smell one  For a second  Just a sniff  What else you got?  Ten years old  Are you gay?  No, no, no  No, no, no  I hate dicks  Hate them  What did I know?  I didn't even get to  Fidget with one  For a minute  This banana's too hard  I'm not saying  I wish I could have  Blown all my friends  To see what it's like  But on Fourth of July  There were fireworks  I was with Matt  There was a feeling  I don't know  What could have happened  I have no idea  Because we were so scared  We were afraid to seem gay  When I was a kid  Because in the 70s  The stereotypes showed you  What everybody's like  Men are like this  And then the women  Have to act like this  And then gay people are like  They're just tired  That was gay people  In the 70s  I'm gay  Help, I'm gay  I can't even do anything  That's what gay men  Were in the 70s  You ever meet a gay person?  You don't fuck with  Gay people  Not today  They're all athletes  First of all  And they got their shit together  They're motherfuckers  Gay people  Your landlord's gay  They're billionaires  They own Apple  They're in the cabinet  They're in the Navy  They're cowboys  And Indians  And construction workers  You ever go into  Gay owned business  He's like, can I help you?  Like the gay's in there  Like the gay's in there  But he's fucking tough now  What do you want?  Gay men are men now  They're fathers  They're husbands  They're men  Today's heterosexual men  Are faggots  On his way out the door  But they're fucking fags  They're intelligent  They're intelligent  And they're evolved  But they're fags  And they're just pale  Almost blue  My wife got a promotion today  Good for you faggot  And when I see a progressive young couple  I always want to stop them  And ask her  Is that turning you on?  Please tell me  Is that sexy?  He gets with the pin man's hand pipe  Just  Just  Strawberry smoke  She's like, well he's very intelligent  And he's conscientious  But does he make your pussy wet?  Fuck no, he's a fag  Faggy straight dude  It's another kind of guy  Welcome  We should have all of it  The whole spectrum  The whole alphabet  All of it  But somebody does have to be  Just straight fucking  You have to have that  It doesn't have to be the most important  But you do need it  Because it's where it all fucking comes from  This is where life still starts  If you want to eat  Local  And organic  You got to respect  Fucking a pussy  For now  It's  Someone needs that  You could do it with an original dick  Wrapped in thigh flesh  Wonderful  You got to respect that  You do  They rip their balls off  It does  Fucking respect  But someone's got to have a factory dick  With matching numbers  Fucking a wet farm raised pussy",
