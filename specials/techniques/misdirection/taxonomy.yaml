primary_categories:
  logical_misdirection:
    definition: "Setup establishes logical path A, punchline follows path B but maintains logical consistency"
    subtypes:
      semantic_reframing:
        definition: "Taking established concept/phrase and analyzing it from unexpected angle"
        example: "Norm's cancer battle - reframes metaphor through literal analysis"
        strength: "Very strong when logical connection is tight"
      
      perspective_shift:
        definition: "Same situation viewed from completely different viewpoint"
        example: "Louis CK's nut allergy - shifts from protection to natural selection"
        strength: "Strong when new perspective is surprising but valid"

  emotional_misdirection:
    definition: "Setup establishes emotional expectation, punchline subverts emotional response"
    subtypes:
      tone_shift:
        definition: "Dramatic change in emotional tone while maintaining topic"
        example: "Dark topic -> light analysis, or vice versa"
        strength: "Very effective for tension release"
      
      empathy_flip:
        definition: "Redirecting audience empathy to unexpected target"
        example: "Sad story about person -> sympathy for inanimate object"
        strength: "Works well with character work"

  contextual_misdirection:
    definition: "Setup establishes context A, punchline reveals context B was relevant all along"
    subtypes:
      frame_shift:
        definition: "Complete change of contextual frame"
        example: "Personal story -> cosmic scale"
        strength: "Strong when both frames are clearly related"
      
      context_merge:
        definition: "Unexpectedly combining two separate contexts"
        example: "Mixing technical analysis with emotional subjects"
        strength: "Very effective when contexts seem incompatible"

  meta_misdirection:
    definition: "Misdirection that works by commenting on or analyzing its own structure"
    subtypes:
      metaphor_deconstruction:
        definition: "Taking common metaphors/phrases and analyzing them literally"
        example: "Norm's 'battle with cancer' analysis"
        strength: "Highly sophisticated when done well"
      
      expectation_commentary:
        definition: "Explicitly acknowledging and then subverting comedy expectations"
        example: "Setting up obvious joke then commenting on its obviousness"
        strength: "Advanced technique, requires audience awareness"

technique_combinations:
  layered_misdirection:
    definition: "Multiple types of misdirection in single joke"
    example: "Norm's cancer joke combines logical, emotional, and meta misdirection"
    notes: "Requires careful balance to not overwhelm audience"

  sequential_misdirection:
    definition: "Series of misdirections building on each other"
    example: "Multiple perspective shifts, each revealing new layer"
    notes: "Effective for longer bits, requires strong callbacks"

detection_hierarchy:
  1: "Identify primary category (logical/emotional/contextual/meta)"
  2: "Determine specific subtype"
  3: "Check for combinations or layering"
  4: "Analyze strength and sophistication level"

strength_factors:
  primary:
    - "Logical consistency"
    - "Surprise factor"
    - "Clarity of connection"
  
  multipliers:
    - "Multiple layers working together"
    - "Meta-awareness"
    - "Callback integration"

training_progression:
  1: "Simple single-category misdirection"
  2: "Strong examples of each subtype"
  3: "Basic combinations"
  4: "Layered misdirection"
  5: "Meta-misdirection and complex structures"

notes:
  - "Each type can be present in varying degrees"
  - "Strength comes from clarity of connection, not complexity"
  - "Meta-techniques require mastery of basic forms"
  - "Consider audience's cognitive load with complex combinations"
