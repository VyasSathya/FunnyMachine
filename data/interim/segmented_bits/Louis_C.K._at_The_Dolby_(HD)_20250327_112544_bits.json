In New York, you walk right by them.  So in New York, they're right there.  They're in your space, they're in your world  and you gotta make a choice.  Every couple of blocks, you gotta make a choice.  You gotta help or not.  You gotta keep shooting it.  You gotta put a limit on it somewhere  because you're not gonna help all of them  and you're not gonna help any of them, really,  with a few bucks.  But there's always that, like, there's a homeless guy  who lives, he doesn't live anywhere,  but I mean, he's, by definition, he's at large.  He's always on the corner by my house.  Same guy, every day.  And I walk past him every day on the way to the store.  I go to the same store every day.  I go to Claire's, I don't know if you know Claire's.  I go there every day.  I buy a handful of scrunchies and I run home.  Everything else I buy online.  And I go, sure, I give him five bucks.  Then I go to this store.  Five minutes later, I walk by and he says,  hey man, he doesn't remember.  Which is fine, but I don't want to give him  another five bucks, you know?  I don't know why.  What am I gonna spoil him?  You know what I was thinking about today?  I was thinking about Jesus today.  And after I came, I feel sorry for Jesus.  That's how I feel.  I don't know how much you know about Jesus,  but I feel fucking bad for Jesus, man.  I do, he had a hard life.  I mean, the last day was particularly difficult,  he had to wear that thong, that fucking dish rag,  yanked up his balls, just carrying his cross  like fucking, it's the rash.  Weird life, I'm reading about Jesus.  I have this book about Jesus.  Only that, just that part.  The rest of it is just the Jews going like,  Then Jacob.  are all like 800 years old.  And then God was like,  So that's them, and that's Jesus.  All those little parts, Jesus.  it's all the same story over and over again.  First Matthew tells it, and then Mark is like,  dude, that's not what, I'm fucking drunk.  Here's what happened.  What happened, Paul, you weren't even here.  Shut the fuck up.  I was raised Catholic,  but they don't encourage you to read the church.  They don't, they don't want you to read this.  And Baptists sit down and they read together.  But the Catholics, they want you to come in the building.  They want you to come in and they tell you.  And you're like, can I read it?  And they're like, no, I'll tell you what happened.  Sorry, put the book down.  But it's interesting,  you think of them as lofty, kind of like,  but some of them are just basic life in Jesus' life.  Okay, here's one.  This is his first miracle.  This is John chapter two, okay?  Okay, and on the third day,  there was a wedding in Canna of Galilee.  to the wedding.  And when they wanted wine,  they have no wine here.  what have I to do with thee?  And he's like, ma!  You know, the rest of the story is that Jesus,  he's at the wedding, they had no wine.  and he was like, look in the water barrel.  Like that, like a close-up magician.  Why don't you take a look?  Maybe it's not the Red Queen.  Go ahead and flip that card over.  What do you think?  Told him to look in the water barrel.  And he looked and it was wine.  He had turned all their water into wine.  Everybody rejoiced.  Except the guy running the wedding was probably like,  we did need some water.  It's actually a bigger problem.  Oh, thanks.  Fuck.  Like Lazarus.  Lazarus had been dead for four days.  And Lazarus comes out of the tomb like.  And Lazarus' wife is like,  are you fucking kidding me right now?  This story, I've never seen it in a Jesus movie.  This story is not in any movies about Jesus.  And it's not, I've never,  Because it's weird.  Because it's weird.  Does anybody by applause know of this story?  Okay, that's just enough to make it clear.  This is true.  I mean, it's not, nothing's true in here.  that I didn't make it up.  They did.  Okay, here's the story.  This is Mark chapter 11.  It's when Mark went broke.  Okay.  And Jesus entered into Jerusalem  and when he had looked around about  and seen all things and the even tide was come,  he went out onto Bethany with the 12.  See, Bethany was like a suburb of Jerusalem.  So he went in Jerusalem.  You know, you see all the shit downtown,  but you don't stay downtown.  You go to the Marriott by the airport.  That's what Bethany was.  Okay.  And on the morrow, when they come from Bethany,  And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves,  he came to it if happily,  he might find anything thereon.  But when he came to the tree,  he found nothing but leaves  And Jesus answered and sayeth unto the tree,  And the disciples heard it.  And in the morning when they passed by,  master behold the fig tree,  which thou dost carthest has withered away and died.  have faith in God.  Good point to this story.  What is the moral?  He was fucking cranky.  And he's like, no fig, fuck you tree.  You're fucking dead, you piece of shit.  I wanted a fig.  You're fucking dead.  Watch this.  I threw it out of season.  You can't act like that, man.  You walk around acting like that,  folks will nail you to a cross.  That's what they'll do.  Little, you know.  That's really what happened.  Got a little shitty.  Little big, you know.  He went to Jerusalem.  He went to Jerusalem.  It's a big town for a boy from Galilee.  He walked in and his friends were like,  King of the Jews, y'all.  King of the motherfucking Jews.  The Jews didn't like that.  The Jews were like, not my president, whatever, you know.  So they nailed him to a cross.  This is what they did.  and all Christianity is this image.  This image is the image of the biggest,  most powerful religion, the cleanest religion.  And it's a fucking dead guy  And it's in every polite room in the world.  and then we always go to look at the fucking,  it's just weird.  honor thy mother and thy father.",

Like, sometimes you give your dog food from your plate.  You're not supposed to,  but you do that because you love your dog.  Remember the other day, your mom and I were like,  don't give the dog any ham,  but you did because you love your dog.

If you kill a three-year-old,  you should do a lot of time.  You should do a lot of time,  unless she's got like diabetes.  You gotta work it all in.  what if you kill somebody who's like 98?  He's 98 and he's like in a hospice.  He's not even good 98.  You know what hospice is?  It's like a hospital where they don't try to help you.  He's, and right then you walk in,  shoot him right in the face.  You should get like five minutes for that.  I was thinking about that today.  Dad, let me tell you something, okay?  My father is not in a hospice.  My dad is in a facility being kept alive  for whose benefit?  I don't get it.  Just died.  She just died.  That's how it works.  By the way, for you young people, here's how life goes.  One of your parents is going to die",

Go ahead, you're gonna die if you don't.  A friend of mine sent me a porn the other day.  Folks can just send you pornography now.  like really old guys, really old.

You can put in a search word to narrow it down  or you can look around, find new things.  I saw a fart porn one time, it was a fart porn.  I never thought I'd be turned on by farts.  I'm not interested in farts.  Farts are okay, I'm farting right now.  I've been farting this whole time.  It was cause of the title.  The title is what got me.  The title was, nice girl farts in your face.  Who's not going to watch that?  Nice girl farts in your face.  So I click on it and there's this girl standing there.  I'm like, she is nice.  She's totally nice.  Just a nice girl standing there.  Pink sweater with little blue buttons on it.  hi, I'm so glad to see you.  I was like, wow, she made me feel good, you know?  And then she turns around, like she's reached,  she goes, I got to show you something.  Like I bought, and she's reaching up  and all of a sudden, and I was like, oh my God.  She seemed so nice.  But the best part is when she, her reaction,  cause I thought she would be like,  that's right, I farted in your face.  But she wasn't.  She was like, oh God, I'm so sorry.  I can't believe that happened.  I've never been that hard in my entire life.  It's not really about the fart.  It's about the shame.  who just thunder farted right in your face  and she regrets it.  Here's the worst part.  I can't find one that good again.  I can't, they're never that good.  I've been chasing the dragon on this fart porn for months.  Like, come on, tighten it up.  Would you, little bitch?  Recently, dating's not fun.  Dating's horrible.  Nobody wants to date.  Even if you meet somebody  and you really want to go out with them  and they say yes, you're excited in that moment.  But the day of the date, you're like,  I don't want to fucking do this.  I don't want to do this.  Every time I'm ringing a doorbell to pick a woman up,  I'm like, I hope she's dead in there.  I really do.  I don't want to sit in a place  and just sweating where your body is folded  You ever have a date that goes well?  It's like good from the beginning.  You're like, you get a little laugh at the beginning.  Hi, ha ha, something funny.  And they both laugh.  Feels good.  You see you agree on stuff.  When you don't agree, you laugh about it.  You're even able to be quiet a little bit  while you're eating and it's nice, feels comfortable.  And then you drop them off and you're like,  I hope I see you again.  And she says, I hope so too.  And you feel like, this is something new in my life.  This is wonderful.  Then you go home and your wife is like,  where were you all night?  You know, you're just fucking.  I'm divorced and I still date mostly women  who are younger than me recently  because that's who looks better.  Nah, it's true.  Like, I've always been with women my age or older.  I was married to a woman a year older than me  for 10 years and that's always been the way I,  but you know, there's some guys  that have to be with a younger woman.  There's cultures that believe the man  should be much older.  should be much older.  you know, like take the man's age  and subtract 10.  And then whatever else you have to do to get to 12,  What happened was I got older  and they got interested in me  because younger women like older guys.  They just do the other part.  Nobody says, I don't do anything to get younger women.  I just stand there like this.  And they see me and they're like,  that would be so weird to fuck that old guy.  You see an older man with a young woman,  everybody's like, that guy's a pervert.  No, she's a pervert.  He's normal.  He likes pretty women.  She likes that.  The fuck is wrong with her?  And they're weird.  I was having sex with this woman  and she was about 35 and we're in bed.  She starts calling me daddy.  I was like, please don't young lady,  please don't do that.  She said, why does it make you uncomfortable  when I call you daddy during sex?  Is it because you have daughters?  I said, no, it makes me uncomfortable  because I have a father and I used to call him daddy  when he fucked me.  By the way, thanks for laughing at me  because I got fucked by my dad.  I was not laughing at the time  because I was coming.  My daddy fucked me so good.  Not his fault, I made him do it.  I was such a brat.  I was 10.  Poor guy, he's like,",
