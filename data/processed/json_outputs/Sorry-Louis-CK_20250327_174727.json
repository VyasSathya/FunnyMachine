It's good  It's really good, nobody gets pregnant  It's a lot of fun  I'm trying to learn things about myself  Um, I got a scale for my bathroom  I'm not trying to lose weight, I'm just interested in the data  And I did learn something  I learned this because I weigh myself every night before I go to bed  And then I also weigh myself in the morning when I get up  And here's what I learned  I weigh two pounds less every morning than when I went to bed  And I found out why, it's because I shit in my bed every night  I do  I take a full two pound dump in bed  And then I turn out the lights and I go to sleep  Because I don't want to sleep alone  Your needs change when you get older  At my age a big pile of shit is as good as anybody  I actually have a girlfriend but we're struggling because she lives in France  She's French, she lives all the way over there  And we haven't been able to see each other for a year because of the disease  I have AIDS  She's great though, she sends me presents all the time  That's how she keeps it going, she sends me gifts in the mail  I get something from her every week  Sometimes it's chocolate from France or a shirt she wishes I would wear instead of things like this  And sometimes she sends something to make fun of me because she's a little fucked up  So last time she sent me a pair of little girls panties  And yeah, I was like, that's not funny  Because these are in my house now  I can't get rid of them, it's like nuclear waste  Think about it, I can't throw them out  Because I can't have people find little girls panties in my garbage with coffee grounds and butter on them  And every solution I think of makes it worse  Like if I put them in a bag inside another bag  And layers of duct tape wrapped in tin foil  Or if I put them in a coffee can and I nail it shut  And I bury it in the park in the middle of the night  Or if I cut them into tiny pieces  And throw away one piece each week in a different town  My friend tried to help me, he's like, why don't you just burn them  I'm like, do you understand?  Even if there's a one in a million chance I get caught burning little girls panties  So I'm wearing them right now  It's the only solution I could come up with  I wear them every day  And I hand wash them  And I dry them like this  Just right on the little strawberries  Here's the thing, men, our biggest fear in life is that we're going to get caught being a kid fucker  That's every guy's biggest fear  Even if you would never do it, every guy's like, that's what's going to happen to me, I know it  It's like being afraid of sharks when you live in the desert  Like I don't go to the ocean but it's going to happen  Because it's a fear not based in its likelihood but in how horrible it would be if it happened  Because when they catch a pedophile, holy fuck  Holy shit  It's brutal because we're scared  We're so scared of pedophilia because it's here and it's not going anywhere  That's a fact  It's not like there's a finite amount of pedophiles and we got the last one  No, it keeps happening  Every generation there's more  Some of you have kids and some of them are going to grow up and fuck kids  They might, you know  Okay, of course not yours for some reason  But they're coming from someplace  So any real solution has to start with the basic reality that there will always be pedophiles  Not a great thought, I understand, it's not an uplifting  You wouldn't put that on a fridge magnet or on your screen saver at the office  There will always be pedophiles  Hey, where's Jim? He's not at his desk  We do, we have to start with that reality because our solutions that we have so far don't really work  Here's our current solution to pedophilia  We wait until somebody fucks about 10,000 kids and then we go, all right, you better cut that out  That's pretty much it  There's no measures for preventing it, none  We have no policy to prevent pedophilia  Not even just like a street sign  There's a street sign for everything  No hunting, no spitting, no skateboarding  I've never seen a don't fuck a child sign, I've been in all over the world  Not even just like a picture of a guy fucking a kid with a line through it  So that it transcends language barriers  I mean, try it  You won't get most of them with the sign  But even if one out of a 50 of them is like, oh shit, I am sorry, I didn't know it was an issue  That's money well spent  There's things that might work and we don't even try them  Like, is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls?  Okay, then let them fuck your kids forever  If that's better, I'm so sorry  For suggesting something that might actually work  Oh no  Let them fuck both my sons, but don't make a doll  That would be distasteful  The thing is that this, I'm still talking about it, this problem  Lose things because we won't really face it, you know  That are important to us, like the Boy Scouts  Boy Scouts, wonderful thing  Being sued out of existence because of all the kid fuckery that goes on  And I know it's upsetting  Because look, here's the thing, the Boy Scouts is a wonderful thing for kids  They go to the woods, they work together, they learn skills  They get in touch with nature  What could it be better for a boy than that?  But some of those guys want to fuck the kids  I don't think they do it a lot  It's not like there's just a shitload of kids being fucked in the Boy Scouts  I think it's mostly that they find out that the guy wants to  I don't actually know though  I don't, do you know why I don't know?  Because I'm afraid to look it up, I'll go to prison for typing it  Google, can you solve a problem if you're afraid to fucking look it up?  How many Boy Scouts get fucked on a...  Every time I move I gotta tell my neighbors that I looked that up  Here's what happens, every few years you find out there's some pedophile type people in the Boy Scouts  And then they announce, we got them, we got them all  We're good  And then a year later, well there's a bunch more  What's going on here?  At some point you gotta wake up to the basic fact  That maybe the people who are best suited to give your kids these wonderful experiences  Are folks that want to fuck them  Maybe that's why they're good at it  Maybe that's, if you want that, that's where you go  Maybe that's just the way that goes  Who else would want to take a bunch of kids to the fucking woods?  Who wants to take your shit kid to the fucking woods?  You don't want to take them  Who would want to do that except people that are barely containing that they want to fuck every kid in the face?  Why? They're good at it, that's what makes them good at it  I'm not saying that all Scout Masters are pedophiles  I might be saying that the best ones are  I might be saying that  That sounds right  So I don't know  You have to lose the whole thing  Just tell your kids, some of those guys want to fuck you  Just be careful  Have a good time  Take the contribution from where it comes  Michael Jackson, wonderful music  Blessed us with wonderful music  Did some other things too  What, look, what's worse?  A pedophile who makes beautiful music or one that doesn't?  The choices  No pedophiles is not on the menu  So how have you all been enjoying living the way I already was for a couple of years before I was...  Bert can't go outside  Can't show your face  Got to wash your groceries  Because I got cum on the groceries  In my mind that's what it means  Maybe that's more in your league  I have a solution for the pandemic by the way  For COVID, I have it  This is it  We test everybody first of all  Every time we find somebody who has COVID  You kill them  That's it  That's the solution  You won't need another one after that one  That's the final one  It's been pretty amazing to be alive during this thing  During COVID because you're not going to see this again  And wow did we learn some shit  That's really the things that teach you in life  Are things you never would have chosen to do for yourself  I mean think about your life as far as it's been  Where you have the choices  Where you're like I'm going to do this  I'm going to pursue this  It all goes to shit  Every bit of it  And even when it goes right  You're like why don't I like it  It's what I wanted  But why don't I like it  Because it's your choice  And your choices are based on fear  And fucking just thin stupid shitty hopes  But when life just kicks you in the balls  And you're like oh fuck everything's different now  It shows you shit you wouldn't have looked at otherwise  That's the great joy in it  And what I thought was really interesting about COVID  And still is  Is that it's the first thing I've seen  Where everyone on earth had the same problem  Every human being on earth had the same problem  We never had that before  That's why we don't give a shit about each other  Because you read like oh there's floods in Houston  And you're like fucking water what is it  What's your problem floods  What is that just walk like this  What you can't handle some water  My basement floods what the fuck  Who gives a shit  He's on a canoe in the street  That looks like fun  Why is that an issue  There's fires in California  What  Blow it out  Get the water from Houston and dump it on California  So I can deal with it  But we all had the same problem  Every person from Zimbabwe to Tokyo to Newark to Honolulu  Everybody was doing the same dumb shit  Every person had the same stupid fucking moment  At the same just trying to get the mask out of the well of your car door  Trying to  I gotta go on Walgreens where's my fucking mask  It's got pistachio shells in it and pennies  I'm sure it's still effective  I actually like the masks because it just everybody looked nice  Everybody did  Because it's just their eyes  Eyes are nice  You never hear somebody say that guy's got gross eyes  It's really we should hide these we should keep the masks  Because this is disgusting  How do we just with no shame look inside my face  Spit at a tongue and teeth  It's fucking gross  Cover your mouth  I'd rather look at your asshole than your mouth  I really would  I'd rather stare into your asshole than glance at your mouth  Assholes aren't that bad not to look at  We don't like to think about asshole  Because you know the shit and the farts and the diarrhea  But that's a small portion of their time  You ever really look at an asshole  You ever really look  Once you see it like in nature  It's just it's a little  That's all  That's your asshole  It's like you know what it is it's just an aperture  That's all it is  That's your asshole  It's like a camera shutter  That's all it is  It's like the opening to the James Bond movies  That's what your asshole  Never go to lick somebody's asshole  And there's a little guy with a gun in there  It was bad  But it really was an interesting social experiment  COVID because everybody got told the same thing  The whole world got told the same thing  If you go out unnecessarily  Millions will die  And a lot of us said  Oh I'm going out  Going now and a lot  Yeah and millions died  It's just we're not that different from the turtles  That you're trying to get them not to cross the fucking highway  And they're like this where I fuck  I fuck over there  Fuck you  And we're like please stop  Putting little signs up  Don't go  And he fuck you  I'm a turtle  It doesn't  We're not that different  We're just a fucking species  And we're just rolling along  Yeah many dying old ladies died  That's what happened  Many dying old ladies finished dying  Here's the way you gotta look at it  Okay we're still making more  We're making new old ladies every day  There's a fresh batch coming  They're gonna be great  I was having sex with a woman once  And she was so beautiful  I was having trouble not coming  So I pictured her face at 80 years old  And then I came immediately  Because she's 92  Anyway  One thing I found very interesting  Was that during the pandemic  A lot of people really liked counting the dead people  That got very popular  Was counting the amount of the dead and dying  Do you know how many people  Just a day  Just a day  Do you know how many people  Day  Have a nice time  Just a day  Keeping a daily tally  There's a lot of shit going on  That we don't keep a daily tally  Of how many babies were dropped in a bucket of paint  I didn't look that up  I'm not kidding you  It's 30 a day  It's a real problem  I'm serious  A steady 30 babies a day  Are dropped in buckets of paint  It's not random  It's one guy that won't stop doing it  Yeah, we liked counting them  We liked counting the dead  And when it got really high  We didn't know how to count them anymore  People trying to find different ways to express the number  Or take it in  Remember January?  It was really bad  It was 3,000 people every day were dying of COVID  So people started saying this  This is 9-11 every day  This is literally  9-11  Every day  When did we start measuring deaths in 9-11s?  When did that become the new  How many football fields long is it?  Per mass death  How many 9-11s was World War II?  Can we look it up?  I know the Holocaust was 2,000 9-11s  9-11 wasn't that bad  It was just one  Only one 9-11 of people died on 9-11  That's like nobody died that day  See it's all relative  Because then you have those  Later  Remember January was really bad  January was the worst  And then in April  March, April  We all felt better  Everybody's like oh it's way better now  It's way better  Way better than January  I looked it up  It was 1,500 people a day  And everybody's like it's way better than January  Really? It's half of 9-11 every single day  But that's way better  That would be like if on 9-11  After the first tower went down  You're like that's not that bad  It's just one  Still got the other one  That's why they made two  It's okay  It's alright to make fun of 9-11  It was a hoax  Sorry  Anyway  Covid about three times  I'm one of those idiots  I was like I think I have it  Can you feel?  I'm bad with pain too  Like the other day I hit my elbow  Right on that spot  Where if I had a gun I'd be dead now  You know that's  I can't do pain  That's why I could never be a cop  I couldn't walk around with a gun right here  There's 50 things a day where I'd be like  Fuck that  That ain't worth  That's my main problem by the way  With the whole defund the police idea  What about people that want to commit suicide by cop?  What about them?  We'll put a pin in that  We had a lot of protests in New York  And now we have protestors that just live here  They're not at a protest  They're just here  I saw a protestor in Washington Square Park  She had green hair and dirty legs  And she's holding a little piece of cardboard  And it's with a Sharpie  It said  Abolish billionaires  She's standing there  And I thought  I don't think that's gonna do it  It doesn't feel like that's gonna result  And Jeff Bezos going  What's happening to me?  Sadly  It's gonna be okay for him  I thought it was good  How young people got out there  And they expressed themselves  They went out there to solve a lot of problems  Not all of the problems  But some of them  They went out there to stop discrimination  Not all discrimination  Just some of it  Which is a weird form of discrimination  But there are groups  There are groups that are discriminated against  Who don't have any protestors  Or any people working for them  And we all discriminate against these people  Like ugly people  Everybody discriminates against ugly people  They do  And it's awful  I'd rather be discriminated against for my race  Than for being ugly  You might not lose a job or a promotion  But nobody kisses you on the lips  Like your whole fucking life  Like try that  This is what we say to ugly people  We don't like your face  We just don't like it  So no one's gonna fall in love with you  And it's unanimous  Sorry  And we just expect ugly people to be like  Oh no I understand  I mean sure  My head shape is no good for you  So I'll go without the things that matter in life  Also overweight people  Overweight people deal with things that  None of us deal with  Because I'm not overweight  There's people who are discriminated against  Just because of their weight  I read a story once  About a woman who's 600 pounds  And she couldn't get medical care  Because everything she goes to the doctor  He just says it's because she's fat  Everything  She's like my knees hurt  He's like yeah my knees hurt  Just looking at you  What do you think is gonna happen?  She's like I have chest pains  He says yeah because your organs are over capacity  So they're hurting  She's like I got shot in the head  He's like yeah because you're fucking fat  Somebody shot you in the fucking head because you're fat  It's a terrible story  Here's the worst part of the story  And this is true  This is true  She needed an MRI  Because she had something serious  She's 600 pounds  She doesn't fit in the machine  You know what they did?  They sent her to the zoo  I'm not kidding  They sent her to the fucking zoo  Fat people  An MRI  Hey here's your prescription  Go to the zoo  Yeah that's where you should go  You should go to the zoo  You know how many fat people we have in this country?  About 600 trillion billion thousands of them  You know how many trans people there are?  About 38  But if you're trans and you need a restroom  And it's awkward  We'll change every restroom  But if you're fat and you need an MRI  You go to the zoo you fat bitch  Just go to the zoo  Go experience that today  That's when she gets to the zoo  Actually fucking happens  When she arrives at the zoo  Hi  Are you here to see the monkeys?  No I'm here for an MRI  Oh shit  Alright  Yeah  Uh huh  Okay just stand in the straw over here  Yeah  You're after the walrus who has lymphoma  An MRI machine at the fucking zoo  Who was it developing that instead of a fat human being MRI?  Who's paying for this shit?  You don't give an elephant a fucking magnetic resonance image test  What are you fucking high?  A scene  If an elephant is sick you just listen  You do this thing  Misa thinks she gonna die didn't you?  I'm saying this out of respect for elephants by the way  Because we're supposed to respect how they live  They don't fucking cure their diseases  This is not their culture  This is our way  Let's fix it  Oh he's sick  That's not how elephants live  An elephant in the Serengeti isn't like I have a lump  I have to see my oncologist  When an elephant gets cancer he falls over  He takes his fucking turn and becomes food  You don't put an elephant in a state of the art  You gonna give him chemotherapy?  Skinny elephant with a pink baseball hat?  Each day is a gift  I love animals I do  I do  We have a weird relationship to animals  We name them and we play with them  And we kill them and we eat them  And we stuff them  And we draw them  I have a dog I love my dog  But I don't know my dog  We've never had a conversation  Not one time  I talk and she just hears  She looks at me and I'm like yes  She's like what you don't know what the fuck I'm thinking  Fuck you  I don't know this bitch  I have no idea what she's thinking  I really wish I did  I wish I knew what she was thinking  It's my biggest wish maybe in life  Is that I knew  Because I know she has thoughts  I know she does  There's no way she's just like dog  There's stuff going on in here  I've seen it  You ever watch your dog make a decision?  You ever watch your dog just walk in the room  And then look around like  You know I'm gonna go over here  Tell me why?  I think my dog thinks I'm insane  Because I look at my life through her eyes  Like I'll watch TV for four hours  And from my dog's point of view  I'm just sitting there  Why the fuck is he laughing?  What happened?  My dog is my life now  Because my kids are growing up  My kids are in college  And they're all you know  I'm an empty nester  That's what you call it  When your kids are gone  Because they grew up  Not if they're dead  It's not used that way  My daughter died of leukemia  Hey, you're an empty nester  I miss it  I miss having little kids  I think about it all the time  I think about it maybe adopting  You know  I could adopt a baby from a third world country  That's a good thing to do  Because you can just leave them outside  You don't have to  You know it's interesting  We've been adopting babies from other countries  In America for a long time  You know other countries do it too  But I live here  So I'll talk about that  But it's an interesting thing  It's not a biological imperative  To go get a baby from thousands of miles away  But we've been doing that in large numbers here  For a long time  And not always for the same reasons  There's been different reasons  Why we've done it  In the early  Like in the 70s when I grew up  Sometimes you meet a couple  Who had an African baby that they brought  Because they're those kind of  You know these kinds of people  You know  The kind of couples that hold hands  When they announce things  You know those kind of people  They gather their friends  And they're like  We've decided  You know those  They have a farm table  With a  Pot of honey on it  And their apple juice is cloudy  You know what I'm talking about  Those are the kind of people  They make a trip to Zimbabwe  And get a baby  And name them Kevin  And send them to Boston College  Whatever  That was like the 70s and 80s  Then in the 90s  It became very popular with gay couples  Started to adopt babies from China  Because they want to have a baby  But they can't  They both have dicks  I don't know if you know that  Did you know that?  Gay couples have two dicks  So they can't make a baby  You can try  You can  Just really fucking  You can  You can try to come into one dick  With the other  Like  If you line up the dick holes  And you can come  And the sperm goes up this dick  And down that one  And then the sperm gets to the balls  And they're like  What the fuck  Where  Did we turn around?  Because we're in the balls again  Balls of these  These aren't even his balls  Oh, he's gay  Fuck, all right  Okay  All right  Well, just swim around until we're dead  The way it is  You're not gonna  A baby will never come out of a penis  Which is good  It's a good thing  Because it's hard for women  Imagine pushing a whole baby  Out of your penis dick hole  Even just a hand  Yeah  Anyway, so that's why gay couples adopt  That's why  And often from China  Because they make a lot of stuff there  So that was that  The gay couples were adopting  Chinese babies  Because they couldn't have babies  And then a lot of other couples  Started doing it  More around the turn of the century  I used to live in Hollywood  Which is a pretty awful place  And everybody there  Gets Chinese babies  It's very popular  They go because  And it's not because  They can't have babies  And it's not because  They're trying to help  Somebody from far away  It's because  They're just busy  They're busy  They want to have a baby  But they don't want to have a baby  You know what I mean?  That thing where  You can't have your baby  And eat it too  I don't know how that works  They don't want to get pregnant  Is the point  So they go to China  They don't even go to China  They go to the airport  And somebody from China meets them  Gives them a baby  It's true  They just take it home  And then they get a Jamaican nanny  To watch their Chinese baby  And they go to cocktail parties  We have a Chinese baby  It's amazing  And meanwhile  The Chinese baby  And the Jamaican nanny  Are just alone  Looking at each other  Like what are we doing?  What is it?  What is this?  Why can't either of us  See our families?  Why?  What the fuck is the point of this?  So yeah  I got my dog  My kids  I just sit around  I watch YouTube a lot  That's my favorite pastime  I was watching YouTube today  I was watching one of the ads  That comes on before the video  I watch  I don't skip those  I think that's rude  It is  It's mean  Somebody worked hard on that ad  They trained a cheetah  To run alongside a Jeep Cherokee  And you're at home like  Three, two, one, fuck off  It's fucking mean  What if you made something, dick?  The ad was a PSA  It was an anti-smoking message  It was a Puerto Rican man  With a hole in his throat  He was like  My father smoked  And my mother smoked  I wish I never smoked in my life  Please don't smoke cigarettes  Cigarettes are very, very bad for you  First thought I had was  Why does he still have an accent?  It's coming out  It feels like if you bypass the mouth  You shouldn't have an accent anymore  Does the machine have a setting for Puerto Rican?  Is that just how air sounds coming out of this guy?  Does he fart with an accent?  Señor, I'm party  Anyway, after the ad  I watched the video that I was looking for  Which was a scene from a movie  And it's a scene that I really hate  Every time I see it, it makes me angry  Which is why I was looking for it on YouTube  And it's a movie I like  I actually like the movie  It's called Good Will Hunting  Remember Good Will Hunting?  Of course, right?  Matt Damon  Great performance  He plays a very complicated young man  Wearing a tight t-shirt for a whole movie  And here's my issue with Good Will Hunting  Matt Damon also wrote the movie, okay?  So he basically sat down and he's like  First of all, I'm amazing  I'm a construction worker  I'm like, working class  And I drink beer and I get in fights  I get in so many fights  My friends are like, you're out of control, man  And I'm like, shut up  This is the way I am  But then also  I'm a genius  Ooh  I didn't even go to school  I just know things  I don't know why  I just know them  And all the nerdy geniuses that studied for years are like  He's so much smarter than us  It's making us upset  It's insane  It's fucking insane  It only makes sense if he wrote it for himself to be the guy  So the scene I was looking for  It's the worst example of that in the movie  Here's what happens  He goes to a bar and he meets a woman  And he likes her  And another guy likes her too  But she picks Matt Damon  Because he wrote the fucking movie  Because he decided, you understand?  She doesn't like him  She likes me  You better believe it  So he gets her phone number  And then he goes outside  And he sees the other guy  In the window of a restaurant  And he decides to taunt him  So he goes over  He tells his friends  Hey, come here  Watch this  And he says to the guy  Hey  Do you like apples?  And the guy says yes  And Matt Damon goes  Well, I got a number  How do you like them apples?  And all Matt Damon's friends go  Oh  You know how he did it?  He wrote the whole fucking movie  He made everybody say all the things  Otherwise this doesn't happen  I mean he hinges the whole fucking prank  On the guy liking apples  The guy must like apples  Who would say yes  To do you like apples?  Coming from a clear antagonist  Gathered his friends  Do you like  Wait guys  Watch this  Do you like apples?  God damn it  I do  I wish I didn't  Because I can tell  This is not going to go my way  But I just  I can't lie  He'll know it  He'll know it  Because boy  Do I like apples  Do you understand?  If he says no  Matt Damon is fucked  He's fucked in the face for life  He's got nothing  Do you like apples?  No  Dude  Fucking guy  No come on seriously  Seriously  You fucking  Don't fucking  Don't fucking  Do you  Do you like bananas?  Do you  Because I thought  Because the woman gave me her telephone number  And isn't that bananas?  I saw a guy  I saw a guy peeling a banana the other day  That's another banana joke  Did you hear the other one  That ended with banana?  Banana  I got three banana jokes by the way  This is number two  Okay  I saw a guy peeling a banana on Sixth Avenue  And it bothered me  And I'll tell you why  Because it's the way he peels  When I peel a banana  I hold it around here  I peel down to my hand  Right?  This guy holds the banana at the bottom  And he just peels the whole thing  All the way down  It felt like a guy at a urinal  Pulling his pants all the way to his ankles  I was like dude  TMI with that banana right now  What are you making a smoothie on Sixth Avenue  What are you doing?  The banana was like  Hey  You don't even know how much you're going to eat  I have a bruise right here  I kind of got lost in the banana shame there  You want to hear the other banana one now?  Okay  So  I was at the grocery store  And I needed bananas  So  I go over to where the bananas are  And there's a black woman at the bananas  It's going to be okay  It's going to be okay I swear  I understand  White people are very scared  Of discussing bananas and black people  In the same conversation  I understand  If I have a black friend over  I would never offer him a banana  I just don't know why  I just wouldn't do it  Hey you want a banana?  Why the fuck you asking me  Hey man sorry  Have an apple  I'm really sorry  These are just the facts of the case  Alright  I was in the store  Looking for bananas  And there was a black woman at the bananas  And I wanted  I didn't want to go there  While she's there  Because of COVID  We're all giving each other space  So I  But I do want to be next  So I'm waiting  And she's kind of taking a long time  And the longer she takes  The longer I am a white man  Watching a black woman choose bananas  And this is an awful thing  About the world today  Because I know I'm not doing  Anything wrong  But I feel fucking bad  I feel fucking bad  So I went to the strawberries  And there's a fucking Jew  With a strawberry  Here's a nice one  That's the Jew  I'm not going to do the black woman  No I'm not  You know why?  Because I'm not afraid of Jews  That's really  That's the bottom line  I'm not scared of Jews  I don't find Jews to be frightening  Unless you're in Palestine  Then they're terrifying  Very different  Over there they're like  The Jews are killing us  And here we're like  Really? The Jews?  We've been slapping them around  For years  This banana's too hard  I'm not going to have them  Until two days old  I'm going to buy the hard one  And wait  Just trying to be fair  Just trying to be fair  To the Jews  Lord have mercy  Anyway  Don't worry  I'm an old man  I'll be gone very soon  I worry about getting old  Only because I don't want  To lose my memory  You know  I mean some of it  I would love to lose  But it doesn't work that way  You got to take it all or none  I guess  But I lose  I forget things  You know  Like remember Fonzie  From Happy Days  I don't remember him  I don't even know  What you're talking about  I forget weird things  You know  Like I was walking  Down the street once  In New York  And there was a guy in a van  And he rolled down the window  And he said  Hey  Get in the van  And suck my dick  And I said  Alright  You know  So  I got in the van  And you know  I was trying to pull the door  The sliding door  But it kept  And he's like  It just shuts  Don't  You don't have to  I was like  Sorry  He's like  Everybody does that  It's okay  So I'm kneeling on the floor  Of the van  On like a purse  And there's no lady in there  But I'm like  I came here to suck  This guy's dick  Not like take inventory  Just in case it works  So I start sucking his dick  And about  Halfway through  I'm guessing  I remembered  That I don't really like doing that  Senior moment  Some people worry about getting old  Because they think it means  That they're dying  Which it does  But this doesn't worry me  I don't worry about dying  Because I think it's necessary  I think it's something  That you just have to do  You should do it  When it's your turn  You should do it  If somebody  You know your doctor says  You're dying  Just say okay  And die  Don't you know  Maybe a miracle  Fuck you  Get in the ground  Just take your turn  I really think that way now  I didn't used to  But I do  Because I  You know when I started  Thinking that way  Was when my mom died  My mom died  A couple years ago  Of anorexia  She was  300 pounds  She was bad at it  I know it was fucked up  Right  What a piece of shit  Anyway  She would have liked that joke  She would have  My mom was fucking  She was gross  And I remember  When she was dying  I was alone with her  And the nurse said  This is imminent  I was like  What does that mean  She goes  She's going to die  In a minute  Like  Just say  In a minute  It's so close  Anyway  I was alone with her  And she died  And I was like  Fuck they're going to think  I did it  Obviously  I didn't want to lose my mom  I really didn't  But we had this one conversation  Like two weeks before  She died  When we were talking about it  And I said  Mom I don't want you to die  And she said  You'll get over it  That's what she said  And I did  In the moment  I wasn't willing to accept it  I was like  I don't want you to go  She said  But we're going in order  Do you understand  This makes sense  I'm your mother  I'm like  Mom stop talking like that  This is sad  She goes  No it's not  Look at it this way  Do you want me to never die  I was like  No I don't want that at all  And it helped me get in touch  With an important idea  Which is that  Dying is important  It's every generation's  The greatest contribution  To history  Is that they die  It's the only thing  That keeps things moving  It's the only reason  There's any progress  In the human race  Is that folks  Keep fucking dying  Every generation has had a mix  Of douche bags  And amazing people  And boring  Great  Good  Whatever  But they're all fucking dead  Every fucking one of them  Thank god  They're all fucking dead  There's a limit  To how much  Any of the good ones did  And the shitty ones  Got to stop being shitty  It's a great system  Now when you look  At the internet  And all these people  You're like  What the fuck is happening  It's okay  They're all going  Every one of them  All of them are gonna die  I mean  You don't want to die  You don't want to die  You don't want your loved ones  To die  But that's a selfish wish  When you think about  What would happen  If nobody died  What kind of world would this be  If there was no dead  Nobody  If we still had people here  From the 1100s  It's hard enough  Having people here  From the 50s  Just sorry  Just scan the code  On the table  There's no menu  What I  Jesus Christ  You want to go through that  With Punch's pilot  And Charlamagne  Fucking pain in the ass  Fucking old people  That don't want to fucking  Just  When you get older  And you start going  Everything is so crazy now  No it's fine  Just get the fuck out  It's great  They're not gonna make  It work for you  You're here for 10 more minutes  Just get the fuck out  If you're in an airport  And you're looking at the toilet  And you're like  I don't understand  How this works  It's time for you to die  That's what that means  These toilets are for the next people  Get the fuck out  That's the way I look at my life now  I had some good  I had some bad  But I'm done  I mean I'll hang around  Because I'm curious  But I'm so interested  In the way things are going  I really am  It's such an interesting time  Such a  We're on a hinge  Such a cool thing  To experience that  I'm excited  About a lot of what's coming  There's things that are hard now  But that's the way it is  Things are gonna get  I think it's exciting  What's happening  I think young people today  Have some great ideas  They're being a little  Cunty about some of them  But the ideas are good  The ideas are good  Like when I was growing up  We had two genders  Male and female  Now you have all these  Expansion teams  I think it's very exciting  It is  And the best idea  Is this gender fluid thing  This is a great fucking idea  Gender fluid  The idea  The way I barely understand it  Is that  You just  Something in the middle  It's like a fretless base  You don't have to be  The specific pictures  What a dumb way to do it  These are the kinds of people  You can be  Which one are you?  I don't feel like  Any of those people  Then you're a failure  You have to fight  Start acting like these people  So we know what to call you  Why?  Just make it  It's just a  Just  A la carte  I like dicks  I don't like balls  I'm a  This and that  Moving through it  Changing  When it feels like it  I wish  What I'm saying is  I wish we had that  When I was a kid  Because I think  Our generation got hurt  By the rigidity  Of identities  And how you had to  Just stick to them  You had to pick one  Right away  You're eight years old  What are you?  I'm a boy  What do you like?  Girls  Vaginas  Love vaginas  I'm eight years old  I never saw one  But I'm  Committing my life  To them right now  I don't even get to  Smell one  For a second  Just a sniff  What else you got?  Ten years old  Are you gay?  No, no, no  I hate dicks  Hate them  What did I know?  I didn't even get to  Fidget with one  For a minute  This banana's too hard  I'm not saying  I wish I could have  Blown all my friends  To see what it's like  But on Fourth of July  There were fireworks  I was with Matt  There was a feeling  I don't know  What could have happened  I have no idea  Because we were so scared  We were afraid to seem gay  When I was a kid  Because in the 70s  The stereotypes showed you  What everybody's like  Men are like this  And then the women  Have to act like this  And then gay people are like  They're just tired  That was gay people  In the 70s  I'm gay  Help, I'm gay  I can't even do anything  That's what gay men  Were in the 70s  You ever meet a gay person?  You don't fuck with  Gay people  Not today  They're all athletes  First of all  And they got their shit together  They're motherfuckers  Gay people  Your landlord's gay  They're billionaires  They own Apple  They're in the cabinet  They're in the Navy  They're cowboys  And Indians  And construction workers  Gay men are men  You ever go into  Gay owned business  He's like, can I help you?  Like the gay's in there  But he's fucking tough now  It's my story motherfucker  What do you want?  Gay men are men now  They're fathers  They're husbands  They're men  Today's heterosexual men  Are faggots  And there's an old man  On his way out the door  But they're fucking fags  They're intelligent  And they're evolved  But they're fags  They're with pajama shorts  And they're just pale  Almost blue  My wife got a promotion today  Good for you faggot  I'm so happy  Bam, I'm happy for him  Sounds like they have a good life together  But it takes some getting used to for me  And when I see a progressive young couple  I always want to stop them  And ask her  Is that turning you on?  Please tell me  Is that sexy?  He gets with the pin man's hand pipe  Just  Strawberry smoke  She's like, well he's very intelligent  And he's conscientious  But does he make your pussy wet?  Fuck no, he's a fag  Great, it's another kind of dude  Faggy straight dude  It's another kind of guy  Welcome  We should have all of it  The whole spectrum  The whole alphabet  All of it  But somebody does have to be  Just straight fucking  You have to have that  It doesn't have to be the most important  But you do need it  Because it's where it all fucking comes from  Until they figure out some other shit  This is where life still starts  If you want to eat  Local  And organic  You got to respect  That someone's got to have a hard dick  Fucking a pussy  That's where every trans  Every gay person came  From two boring straight people fucking  For now  It's  Someone needs that  You could do it with an original dick  Not a turned inside out pussy  Wrapped in thigh flesh  Which is wonderful  Wonderful  You got to respect that  You do  Somebody who wants to be themselves so bad  They rip their balls off  That takes balls to do that  It does  Fucking respect  But someone's got to have a factory dick  With matching numbers  Fucking a wet farm raised pussy  Thank you very much  Good night everybody  Thank you",
