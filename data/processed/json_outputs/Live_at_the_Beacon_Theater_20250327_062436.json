  "transcript": " Just let's start, okay, kill the house events that you would have heard, please turn off  your cell phones, don't, I mean you can take pictures, but turn off the flash, that's  stupid because it's not like when you're watching the World Series and there's all  like that, like your flash is lighting Yankee Stadium, just leave your flash off.  If you have, don't yell out during the show.  If you have something you want to say to me, totally this is what we do, we  down and then you go outside in the lobby and then you go home and you kill  yourself. That's selfish, this is a rhetorical performance, it's got nothing to do  with you. Don't text or Twitter during the show, just live your life, don't  keep telling people what you're doing, just because also your big dumb face,  it lights it up. I see this beautiful sea of darkness within just one guy,  so don't do that. What else, no Jews, I think they said that earlier, they  told me I have to say it, Jews aren't allowed, if you're Jewish this is a good  time to go if you're, if you see somebody kind of Jew-y looking then  please tell an usher and they will, sir come on, let's go, come on, let's go.  But I'm really glad you're here, this is a sizable crowd, this is a big  place, it's about 2,500 people here and that's, that's enough people to be  like a sample of the population. 2,500 people is enough people that you're all  gonna experience a lot, there's enough people here to say that within two  months at least one of you will die. I think it's probably accurate to say  that out of any random group of 2,500 people not all of you are gonna  make it to Christmas unfortunately. None of you here tonight is going to ruin your  family's Christmas by dying a shitty death and I don't know who it is, I'm  sorry. Whatever, some people they want you to do things when they die with  their like I want you to take my ashes and sprinkle, fuck you I'm not  doing none of that shit. You're gonna run errands for you after you're dead. Some people  try to do something you know noble with their bodies, they try to have  their bodies have some use after they're dead which I think is a good  thought. You're only borrowing your body, you're only borrowing everything. If  your body's worth anything when you're done with it you should pass it on.  That's something I really believe. I mean I'm not gonna do it because I  don't want to, ew it's mine. I don't want, I don't, I have a lot of beliefs  and I live by none of them. That's just the way I am. They're just my  beliefs. I just like believing them. I like that part. They're my little  believies. They make me feel good about who I am but if they get it in  the way of a thing I want or I want it in Jack Oliver's I fucking do that. But some people take  their body, my grandma, grandmother, she just for the layman, my  grandmother she gave her body to a medical school so it free to just be  examined and dissected which is a good thought for that but you know  they're her survivors or her family. That was a person. That was my  grandmother. She used to wear glasses and say things and now she's just  shaved head on a metal table with a hungover medical student trying to dig  out her pancreas and he gets an F. Imagine being the body where the kid got an F on you.  The teacher's like no you idiot and he writes F on her tit with a  sharpie and just throws her down a chute on a pilot F body. So I don't care about her.  Shut up idiot. Just shut your fucking mouth. Did you hear me before?  Okay so what am I gonna do with my body? I'm gonna die and I gotta tell  people what to do with my remains and I have an idea for something to do  with my body or for other people to do with it that will do good in the  world and it doesn't exist yet as like an institution but I'm gonna  create it starting with my body and what it is it's a place where you  can go and be with a dead body and you just do whatever you want and the  have sexual compulsions and they can't control them and so they go and they  bother alive people and this you get it out of your system this is the deal  you go in the room there's nobody else with you you get 90 minutes you just  do whatever you want whatever it is shit in my mouth you want to stick my  toe in your pussy piss on my face whatever thing you got to do jack  off with the cartilage of my ear that whatever is your heart's desire I  want I want to be the Willy Wonka for purpose I want sexual perversion is a  problem it's you can't stop it people got to do what they got to do and you  know this country is pretty perverted I mean we have to jack off to  everything there's nothing that just gets that there's not like sex and  then everything sex isn't everything you watch the news and there's a  woman like tell you and in Libya like yeah well tell me about Libya  tell me about Libya say Libya again come on fucking right up to the screen in my flat  screen come on say Libya again just be a person in Libya whatever why does it  have to all be so sexualized and music like everything is like every  musician is attractive isn't that a weird coincidence that everyone who  can play music also looks good I would have thought there'd be like one  ugly guy with a guitar who would be amazing but fucking zero and there's  like teen pop idols who are children and they're on TV like going it's a kid  and folks are jacking off to them folks well folks are jacking off to  the girls on TV I can't think I don't know their names I don't have that  knowledge anymore I'm too old Britney Spears is like when I think of a  teen idol this Britney Spears that's hold up because she's my age now that's  how long ago that was she caught up to me when I was 35 she was 18 and now we're both  44 years old so that's how that's how little I know about who these  people are I was thinking the other day what if there was a baby who was  born who and there's been a lot of fucked up babies there's all kinds of  born there's been babies with you know connected at the face to a dog or  whatever there's been babies with three legs with hands on them there's been  Chinese babies that's the worst thing I ever said I think I just finally said  the worst thing I have ever said totally unredeeming and horrible and it  feels good it feels good to have found bottom it's a comfort in knowing that  I just said the worst thing I'll ever say in the rest of my life it's good  all right yeah I'm not a good guy I am not I wish I was a good guy like  the idea of being a good guy sometimes I have an opportunity to be a  do it I was on a plane once and I was flying first class because I had a thing  I fly first class who cares just that's the way it is I don't I'm not  like you I'm not I'm not all the things you do I do a better version of  all those things and it's only for another year at the most believe me  it's not gonna last it's been about eight months I got a year left and  I'm back to being just like you but for now it's pretty good so I'm into a  first-class seat and first class is so crazily better it's so much better you  get a bigger seat you get food but also you get to sit and first you get  to sit before anybody else does they sit you down and you get to just sit  there with champagne and watch all the sweaty just miserable all the  single moms hefting their stroller and the kid and you know that looks heavy  and nobody's helping you that's a drag for his first class and a soldier gets  on a plane I see soldiers fly all the time because that's how they get to  the war if they fly on a shitty airline you think they get to go in a  cool green plane with a red light no they just go to Delta and they  just wait in line to go to a war and they always fly coach I've never seen  the soldier in first class in my life it could be a full bird colonel he's  between two fat guys and coach and they're always nice I've never seen a  soldier get on the plane like yeah I'm in the army fuck you I have a gun they're  always like oh yes sir thank you yes thank you very much ma'am it's like  having an extra flight attendant they help everybody put their shit up they're  awesome and every time that I see a soldier on a plane I always think you  know what I should give him my seat it's it would be the right thing to do  would be easy to do and it would mean a lot to him I could give him I could  go up to him hey son I get to call him son hey son go ahead and take my  seat because I'm in first class why for being a professional asshole I'm  in first class because I talk about babies with big dicks that's what got  me my seat the guy is giving his life for the country he thinks and so  but that's good enough I'm serious these fucking told by everybody in his  life system that that's a great thing to do and he's doing it and it's scary  but he's doing and he's sitting in this shitty seat and I should trade  with him I never have let me make that clear I've never done it once  I've had so many opportunities I never even really seriously came  close and here's the worst part I still just enjoyed the fantasy for  myself to enjoy be proud of myself for having thought of it I am such a sweet  man to think of doing that and then totally never do it at least you  should be good just to the people just turn a good face to the people  that you that you that you see in life I don't do that either because  when I get like I get in the elevator my building that's my first  contact with human beings always after being home and just being  disgusting for hours then I come out in the elevator and there's always a guy in  my elevator who's nice and I hate it I get really upset when people say say  nice things to me that's not a good impulse I get the elevator there's  always this one guy who just he sticks his face right in the front of  his fucking head and he hi like he just floats it out there like a big  balloon you know hey how's it going I get upset I get cagey I get this  weird impulse and I want to come on his face I don't know why that's the  thing but that's what I think about is that I wish I could just secrete come  without the sexual workup like as a defense you know like a squid or a  skunk not sexually I mean aggressively you just came in my eye I just want  to go downstairs I want to talk alright this is going a little off  the rails I don't remember what else trying to say I'd like to be a  better person I would I'd like to be a better person and I think I'm getting  worse as a person because as you get older you start finding out like let  me give you an example before I took I was I rented a car a couple weeks  ago in Los Angeles had the car for a few days and then when I went home  I had to drop the car at the rental you know you got to go to the  rental place that's off the airport give them the car give them your  thing with the mileage you got to get on a bus and then go to your  terminal and check in I was late and I was worried about missing my  flight so I knew I had no time to do any of that so I just I never did this  before I just drove my car right to the terminal and just left it there and  once I was on the plane and I had a little moment I called Hertz and I  said hey listen your car is sitting out in front of terminal four and the  keys are in it so that's where it is I think I was like you can't do  that you have to return it to this location and then get and I go why  didn't do that already and now I'm leaving California so if you want your  car you need to go to that place where it is and he was like oh Jesus man  all right we'll get it that was the end of it and I could do this every time  I rent a car because of course they want you to do all that shit but if  you don't they still want the car back they're gonna send a dude a  you don't want just get out of it while it's moving and just walk away I don't  feel like getting in that car any longer just call her it's how your car  is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway if you're interested  it's now your problem but see this is a terrible realization because you  should act in a way that if everybody acted that way things would  work out you should because it would be mayhem if everybody was like that  and most people kind of don't care most people are very selfish most people  don't give a shit what happens as long as they get to do their favorite  thing people don't even want to back off from their favorite thing they  won't even do their second favorite thing like you ever seen somebody and  try like they're at an intersection and they want to make a left but  they're in the right all the way right lane because they messed up so  here's the guy he's in the right lane and there's a lot of cars like  6th Avenue like a lot of cars and he wants to make that left so what does  he do he just does it anyway he just goes ahead and he just shoves his car  through everybody's life without any and everybody's be honking and  outraged and you always see the guy I have to ask the whole thing  block and then go left and take four seconds my criteria but I'm pretty I'm  selfish I would like to be a better person because I got kids and I want  to you know pass on a better but I sometimes it's not clear what the  right thing is to do like one time I I threw a candy wrapper on the  street and I didn't do it like yeah I just take that shit straight I did  because I was you know shaking I wanted the candy anyway I was with a  friend who said to me you just littered on the street don't you care about the  environment and I thought about it and I said you know what this isn't the  environment this is New York City this is not the environment this is  where people live New York City is not the environment New York City is a  next to Mexico City the shittiest piece of litter in the world just a pussy runny  smoking stinking piece of litter so if you have a piece of litter what are  you supposed to do with it you should throw it on the pile of litter put it in a  receptacle then it gets collected and it gets taken to a dump in a  landfill then or it goes on a boat in the ocean and some dolphin wears it  as a hat on its face for ten years this hat that never dissolves on its face  oh Jesus I mean everything that we introduce to the world is shitty meaning  white people because white people are from like another planet because we  like when we came to America it was so nice it was just Indians and they  we call them that by accident and we still call them we came here like hey  you're Indians right and they're like no no this is India right no it's not  it's totally other place you're not Indians no ah you're Indians yeah Indians  for hundreds of years after everything here this was the great it was just  coast-to-coast green brown and beautiful and and all the humans were  just walking around with painted faces just walking and they'd be like oh that  looks yummy and they just eat from the ground and then they'd sleep on the  grass and they wake up and they fuck and then they go for a swim and do  a little dance that was the whole continent was just folks doing that I  mean there was people in Mexico cutting off kids heads and rolling  them down the pyramid stairs but that's I mean that's that's gonna that's always  going on what are you gonna you know you can't you can't do a whole lot  about that I think we came from another planet and the reason is because we  don't like it here I mean why if we're from here if we belong on earth  why aren't we comfortable on earth at all we need nice smooth surfaces and  angles and we need it to be cool and not too hot when it's hot why wouldn't  we just yeah fuck it why wouldn't we be like that if we belong here and it's  weird because people people that aren't whatever you call the you know  there's environmentalists and then there's people who are whatever they  just are a hate environmentalist but that's what people get angry  environmentalist because they think it's they're slowing down the  economy and creating restrictions and a lot of these people are Christian  a lot of these people are very devout Christians and that's such a confusing  thing to me that if you believe that God gave you the earth that God created  the earth for you why would you not be have to look after it why would you  not think that when he came back he wouldn't go what the fuck did you do  what did you do this shit who spilled this come over did you  this what is that it's oil it's just some oil I didn't mean to spill well  why did you take it out of the fuck because they wanted to go faster not  fast enough and I was cold well cuz jobs what is the job what is explain  to me what's a fucking job like you work at a place and when people call  when they their game doesn't work and you help them figure it out what  money what yeah but it doesn't it doesn't have like bacon around it and  like like bacon on it I watched somebody do that the other day after  a meal they went oh it was just and I started wondering what does that mean  what does that signify I think what it means is that you ate something so  delicious that you then kissed somebody on the asshole and their  exploded that's some good eating that's a nice sauce is that good now let me  show you let me have some of that that just destroyed my anus anyway you  know I got kids and sort of what I'm trying to say it's hard having kids  because it's boring that really is the hardest part of having kids ask any  parent what's the hard part is it looking after their health care is it  sure that their education no it's just being with them on the floor while they  be children it's just they read Clifford the big red dog to you at a  rate of 50 minutes a page and you have to sit there and be horribly proud  and bored at the same time I hate Clifford the big red dog I hate him  there's 50 books about Clifford the big red dog 50 books there's seven books  about Narnia that cover the birth and death of a nation and mice with swords  and a lion who's a god they did it in seven books 50 books about Clifford  the big red dog and they all tell the exact same story look how big this  dog is that's it that's it look how big this dog is it's the whole book here's  how big he was at the firehouse here's how big he was at Thanksgiving who  gives a shit you just drew him big just on purpose made him bigger than  people it should be look how big I drew the dog in this book isn't that a  mistake there's no story you maybe even just room closer to the page I  don't even know if you did it honestly be about Clifford make  something happen where maybe he steps on a policeman and shatters his spine  and it's devastating to the community he hangs on for two months and then  dies and there's a whole you know funeral with bagpipes and everybody's  crying and Clifford gets the death penalty and they there's a whole  book about his appeal process and how he found Jesus but everybody said it was  bullshit the cops wife was like I want that dog dead and then he goes to  the chair and they shave all his red fur off and now he's Clifford the big  pink dog you put him on a big funny electric chair that the town got  together and built it's boring having kids you gotta play kid games you  gotta play board games little kid board games where you and you go you got a  six honey one three it's just here just go here it's just daddy I'm  learning I know you're gonna grow up stupid because I'm bored I can't take it  baby I can't I can't watch it I'm bored more than I love you I can't I  just come on my girls are six and nine now they're actually a really  exciting age because they're learning to do some cool stuff I  played Monopoly with my kids that's really fun my nine-year-old she can  totally do Monopoly the six-year-old actually totally gets how the game  works but she's not emotionally developed enough to handle her  inevitable loss in every game of Monopoly because the Monopoly loss is  dark it's heavy it's not only when you lose it you know candy land but  when she loses it Monopoly I gotta look at her little face and I go  okay so here's what's gonna happen now okay all your property everything you  have all the railroads your houses all your money that's mine now gotta give  it all to me give it to me that's right and no no you can't play any  more see because even though you're giving me all of that it doesn't even  touch how much you owe me doesn't even touch it baby you're going down  it's really bad all you've been working for all day I'm gonna take it now and  I'm gonna use it to destroy your sister I mean I'm gonna ruin her it's  just mayhem on this board for her now when you have kids you also have  to belong to kid and parent culture you have to know a lot of parents  and a lot of other kids you have to hang out with other kids sometimes  they're not even kids you know like when I go to parks with my kids I  play with them I play with my kids some people don't do that they neglect  their kids take their kids to the parks they don't have to talk to them and  those kids kind of glom on to our shit like I'll be sitting at the park  playing a fun game with my kids and then there's this woman over in a  bench and she's got her phone she's just staring at her phone and her  kids like mommy talk just leave me alone I'm trying to cheat on your  father and then the kid comes up to us can I be in your family it's  creepy one time I was at a swimming pool with my kids a public pool and I  had my daughter my six-year-old on my arm like this she was like clamped on  and she's kicking it was so much fun and then she got off and another  random child just  I think the kids dead I don't know what happened some kids in my kids  class I like some of those kids those kids are cool they come over my  I like them other kids I don't like especially little boys little boys in my  kids class I hate them I hate little boys I'm like the opposite of a  pedophile I just hate there's one kid in my daughter's class who I hate so  much and it's really fucked up cuz I'm 44 and I hate a six-year-old I  I mean I hate them with a grown-up preoccupying hate I've thought about  them three times since I came out here that's how much I really hate this  kid I'm gonna tell you about him I have to make up a name because he's a  real child who lives in this city so I have to make up a name in order  to tell the story about him his name is just just saying the post  let's just call him Santa just saying the puss fine okay he's in my  daughter's class they're in first grade and when we take our kids to  class there's a little procedure you bring your kid to school and they have  their backpack and their jacket and they go to their cubby and they take  it all off and they put it in the cubby then they take their the  homework folder and their lunchbox and put them in the bins it's little  those are their little responsibilities he helped them do it so they'll  blah blah blah but just and the puss when he comes in he doesn't do  of that shit he just walks in and just sheds it all he just piece of shit mom I  hate his mother because you hate a weak parent when you're a parent because  it's like you're raising Hitler motherfucker do your job get in  there class were a platoon of soldiers she'd be the one that we put  soap bars and socks and we'd frag that bitch in her sleep she would  right the fuck out she wouldn't make it when she's in the puss drops his shit  this bitch picks it up she doesn't she just goes for him which frees him  up to punch other kids in the face because he's a shitty horrible violent  child one time I was at school and I was volunteering at recess it's  something you do you know if you're a good parent but once a month or  whatever it is you go to school and you just stand there you watch recess  you masturbate whatever you want to do that is now the worst thing that's the  worst thing now that's the worst thing I ever said okay all right okay we'll  find it I mean you could it's a public school nobody would even give  a shit but I haven't thus far hasn't gotten that bad I'm watching recess  and recess is a trip if you ever if you've never been to recess it's  intense because it's like the universe like you know if you watch the ocean  crash waves on the beach for a long time you start feeling like you're  understanding how everything works that's what recess is like because  every natural chaotic energy is represented at recess there's kids  swirling around and these big roiling crazy things there's one kid just  spazzing out just some singularity kid just a binary system of two kids  holding hands and they're running and just clothes lining every child at a  height they're keeping a uniform height to the playground so I'm watching  recess and I see then bus and he's walking with this evil this kid is  like evil stuck out of time he's like I always picture him in a gray fur  coat with bones in it and lots of rings from people that he killed and  just walk in and then I see my daughter and she's standing there by  herself and there's just an the puss and I know he's he's going for her it  was like a like an action movie thrillers like and I think to myself  I gotta go there and I gotta protect her but then I thought let him do a  little something first let him do just a little something because I want to  I want this kid in my life I want I want a reason I want aerial photos of  doing some shit to my family that I can bring to the UN and get authority to  waterboard this little motherfucker I want to get him on a flight to  Venezuela with an envelope on his head duct tape and all that shit so anyway  he goes for her grabs her arm starts twisting it she goes I run over I'm  just knocking kids over I run grab him and I look in his little face  and I go just listen to me just stand the push if you ever ever in your life  touch her again and as I'm doing this I realize this is not cool that I'm  doing this totally inappropriate it's really wrong it's way over the top  it's too grown up I mean it's like he's a drug dealer in my building  that I finally fucking this is now motherfucker I will cut you I don't care  and he starts crying pitifully and I just I just walked away from him I just  got away and then all the teachers everybody that's wrong with you and he's  like articulated because he's not getting educated fuck him you would  have told on me bitch but you're too stupid now which is your own fault  future ditch digging piece of shit oh I'm gonna love watching you grow up  into nothing motherfucker I'm gonna watch it and I'm gonna fuck your mom  and not call her too I'm gonna ruin her summer I'm gonna fuck your mom twice  and then never call her and I don't know your dad cuz he ran out on you  but I'm gonna find him I'm gonna turn myself gay and then I'm gonna  fuck him too I'm gonna fuck and I'm gonna suck his dick so good that he  just has to change his whole life and he we're gonna I'm gonna move into a  place with him in the village for a couple of months and totally he'll cut  off ties to all his life and start wearing cutoffs that are really tight  and he'll just and then I'll go to some Christian turn you not gay place  and I'll come back go throw you faggot and make him feel bad inside  like what has he done you got to protect your kids you got a lot of  people talk to talk but you know a lot of people say that shit I would throw  myself under a bus for my so yeah would you fuck another kid's dad and  confuse him sexually and you're self sexually in the process and use  homophobia that you hate against another person just because some kids  shove your kid for a second I got it's my baby girl I got to do it son  I gotta suck that dick that's my baby girl I gotta do it for her I hate that child that's  I've been thinking about my memories because I have kids now and my kids are  in an age where I remember being their age I remember being a six-year-old  I remember being a nine-year-old that's a big threshold that my kids  have crossed is that I remember being their age because when you're raising  kids you're not raising the kid in front of you you're raising the  grown-up that they're gonna be later and I was a kid once when I when  they were babies I didn't really relate to them because they're babies  a baby is not gonna remember shit that is happening to it if you have a  baby keep it alive and enjoy yourself but really the baby doesn't it's not  gonna matter a baby is not accumulating anything it's like an  etch a sketch that you shake every day it doesn't really doesn't matter  you go up to your baby's face every day you fuck you baby like right  every day wouldn't matter I mean they'll grow up with a general  sadness inside they won't actually remember why and memories are weird  because memories get distorted by who you are now and who you were when you  experienced them like I remember when I first started doing stand-up I was  living in Boston and there was one club that was owned by a gay guy and  my memory is that that guy was always trying to fuck me that's my  memory I've carried it for 20 years there was a gay guy tried to fuck me  all the time every instantly I caught up with an old friend of mine from those  days who I hadn't seen in years and we started talking about different  people and he brought him up and I said that guy always used to try to  fuck me and he goes he did I was like yeah and he goes really did he I  mean did he like take you to his house or something and really try to  physically no it's just that you know I mean you try to fuck me all  the time he's like well did he say that he push you and you know say  stuff all the time and make you uncomfortable no it just was and as we  went through it I finally the truth that came out was the whole story  really was there once was a gay man that's really what happened he was  gay I was 19 and now he tried to fuck me all the time like I went  through life with that but I'm trying to remember what is my first  memory like where to how far did my memories go and I remember my  first memory I was four years old and I was standing in front of my parents  house and I was shitting in my pants I was just shitting a massive terribly  painful shit and I was halfway through the shit that's my first  memory is being halfway the first half of the shit I don't remember it  that's still in the ether of infancy the center of this shit was  so wide that I actually came online as a result of the anal pain that I was  experiencing it actually awakened me and stream of consciousness I'm now  living that's how my life started that's who I am a lot of my memories  I don't like I don't like when I was a teenager I hated all that time I  hated being a teenager and then I discovered drugs and then that's all I  the fuck do you compete with that how do you take a miserable person with no  control over their lives and tell them with a straight face oh you can't do  drugs you can't do that baby all drugs are a perfect solution every problem  you have right now how do you beat that drugs are so fucking good that  they'll ruin your life I can't do drugs now because I'm 44 and I can't  hook it up I can't make that happen if you're 44 and you want to get a high  you got to hurt your back that's pretty much the only option you have  hurt your back get some Percocet and then you get a babysitter and take  three at a diner like just sad I'm a little drowsy I really could have like  I I wish I was a drunk like that I love romantically the idea of being a  real drunk in my bathrobe all day everybody who loves him he's always  crying he's destroying himself I can't watch anymore  shit up dude yeah showing up in my kids school play halfway through you show  I wish I could be that guy but I can't drink because I just get tired I go  to sleep I don't know how people drink and then do shit like when I see  movies or TV shows where there's people in an office having a power  meeting and they're clink clink they're making a drink in the  daylight with a tie on well senator hope you play ball with us in this  stretchy deal you know what I'm saying yeah well I'll see what's in it for me  next scene not all those people just lying on the floor like oh I can't  leave my drink whiskey at noon I can't smoke pot cuz it's the same thing I'm  too old for it sometimes young people come up to me after shows hey do you  want to smoke some pot I'm like can I get my portion to smoke without  you alone later because I don't want to stand in a parking lot with some  20 year olds last time I got a high I was in Kansas City and I got  high cuz I was in Kansas City and it's shitty so after the show these kids  that worked at the club they're like you want to smoke some pot I'm like  yes so I'm standing in a parking lot with these kids like 20 years old and  we're smoking a joint and I'm taking huge hits because I have no idea I  didn't know they've been working on this shit like it's the cure for  cancer I didn't understand the fucking technology that's gone into making  pot so powerful because when I was a kid you could just smoke a joint for  a while now you take two hits and you go insane it's not doable anymore and I  was taking big hits like big 1970s jean jacket bad company hits whole of  no here the absence of flesh in his ear with the wood I don't know what  that is even he was like that you should be careful that's a lot of pot  that's very strong marijuana yeah fine just fucking and in about 10 seconds  everything just be and I'm like oh shit this is an ordeal now I'm not  gonna feel okay for a very long time he's just standing around and talking  and I'm hoping like I'm really hoping that I look like this but I'm  sure that I was just scanning insanely I was actually counting like look at  her for five four three two one switch to him five four three two  randomized don't go to the same direction five four three nod your head  that looks like you're listening if you nod your head and at one point I  realized I need to get out of here because the air is hitting my arm  weirdly and they can tell they totally know that I'm not handling the way air  is touching my arm right now why am I doing that with my hand that's weird  to do that with your hand nobody stands like this nobody stands like  this just fucking no that's also that's weird too that's crazy just I  gotta go but I didn't know how to leave because I had this dilemma we're  all standing in a perfect circle facing each other and I thought it's  insane if I just turn my I'm one person with my back now do I just back away  like this home that they fill in and I thought no say something say  something out loud to them that smooths the transition of you leaving  okay what do I say pick a thing to say goodbye that's it that's a  nightmare that's just goodbye that's not even that's his noises finally I  said I know it was that bad because they all went home okay you all never  see those people you know as long as I live and then I had to get in the  court I forgot that I had rented a car and I have to drive back to the  hotel and I'm driving on this highway in Missouri and at one point I  realized I think it's been about 25 minutes since I looked out the front  window of this car I've just been dealing with shit directly in shit to  the whole spectrum of responsibility out here I'm supposed to take part in  this and then at one point I remember I was at a drive-thru and I was  terrified because there's a lady sticking her head out a window and she's  mad she's going sir sir I don't know I don't know I don't know the window  closed I had no fucking idea what part of the transaction of my menace is  he so I can't do that anymore but you know you get older and some  things you can't do anymore some things you don't want to do anymore  that's a nice change you feel some desires fall away new things make you  happy but some things don't change and some things I'm sick of like the  constant just the constant perverted sexual fuckers I'm so tired of those  just the kind of it makes me into an idiot I'm jacking off the morons and  then look at my kids yeah you're awesome it's just a dumb part of life  that I'm sick of it's all day too it's just you can't have a day I just  want to be a person in clothes walking in a store and just I just  want to go to the library and ask her hi ma'am is I'm looking for a  early Abraham Lincoln like when he was  wrap your hair around my dick shit I'm trying to talk to her  male problem it's really a male problem not being able to control your  constant sexual impulse women try to compete like well I'm a pervert you  don't know I have really sick sexual thoughts no you have no idea you  have no idea cuz you get to have those thoughts I have to have them you're  you're you're a tourist in sexual perversion I'm a prisoner there you're  Jane Fonda on a tank I'm John McCain in the hut it's a nightmare I can't  can't lift my arms and for you know men we just sex is such a constant  thing we do it's not even sex to us it's just pussy that's what we call  it pussy it's such a complex nothing to do with women it's not about girls or  chicks like it was in the 50s there's no guys anywhere in the world saying  let's go meet some chicks and kiss them on the mouth and see what happens  there's none of that hmm I sure would like to have a girl my arm  around a girl this mmm Vanessa I'd love no it's not it's just pussy  pussy it's not even a pussy it's not some people's pussies it's just pussy  like big pink balloon letters in front of our faces all the time to men  it's just an element of the universe like it should be on the chart of the  elements next to tin and ammonia put pY with an atomic weight of 12 or  whatever pussy Adams way the sad thing is that for all our obsession about  sex and how much we love it we suck at it men are terrible at sex and never  even a curse to us to do it well women just make sex great women are  the good part of sex they accept the dick with grace and they turn it  into art or they climb on and they ride mmm they go for a ride men  don't we just get we just climb on  we're so bad at sex and then we wonder why women aren't like really  aggressive about sex we think it's because they don't have as much desire  as we do that's how stupid men are that we think they just they're just  weird the swimming are like fucked up in a head because they don't want to just  fuck all the time if I was a woman I just fuck everybody why don't they want  to fuck all the time I do of course you do because when you fuck you get  to fuck a woman when she fucks she has to fuck a guy widely different  experience for a man 100% of the time he's fucking a woman it's the  greatest thing that ever happened in his entire life for a woman about 40%  of the time she's being fucked by a guy she's thinking I'll get over this  in a week it's not the worst thing I'm not gonna cry this time  how bad men are at sex is it after sex you're looking at two very  different people the man just wants to lay there be cool and the woman  it wants to cuddle something that men love to make fun of women for they  want cuddles so needy I already fucked you just let me watch the game  why is she so needy she's not needy you idiot she's horny because you did  nothing for her her pussy is unfucked completely you're fine you climbed on  and she's on you because she's going what that's something else this is bullshit  well she will leave you alone thanks a lot buddy thanks a lot folks I hope  you enjoyed this good night",
