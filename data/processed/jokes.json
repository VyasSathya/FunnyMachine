Anything else you say is you trying really hard not to say I want to  fuck your face. That's the only thing you're, I want to put my penis in the lowest  hole in your head. I was never good at that. Like I was very bad at being  single which is a problem because I'm divorced so I'm single again after 10  years of marriage. And no, here, cut the shit. Don't even start with that",

    "text": " noise like a puppy died. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you  something. And this is important because someday one of your friends is  gonna get divorced. It's gonna happen and they're gonna tell you don't go  aww sorry. That's a stupid thing to say. It really is. First of all you're  making them feel bad for being really happy which isn't fair. Let me explain  something. Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird but it's true  because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It's really that simple.  That's never happened. That would be sad if two people were married and  they were really happy and they just had a great thing and then they  divorced. That would be really sad. But that has happened zero times. Literally  zero. Ray Charles has killed more Jews than happy marriages have ended in  divorce. So if your friend got divorced it means things were bad and  now they're I mean they're better. They're not good. Life is shit wall  to wall but they're better so you should be happy. But the part that's  being single at 41 after 10 years of marriage and two kids it's that's like  having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn't exist  anymore. Like like I found 500 million Prussian francs. I can't really take  advantage of being single because I didn't I didn't expect to be single.  I'm not prepared. I didn't think I'd ever be I didn't keep this shit up.  You understand? I didn't maintain any of this at presentation condition. It's  function only. It was not think I would need it that way. I thought I was gonna  be shoving it into the same person every three months till one of us  died. What I thought was the nature of the deployment for this. I didn't  think I had to be like appealing to someone from scratch. It's like  having a 73 Dodge Dart in your backyard and it's been sitting back  there with grass growing. You don't have any it's not an old Mustang. You have  no plans to restore that dart. You don't even see it when you look out  the window and now you find out that's your only way to work. You need  that car now. You're like oh shit it's got bees in it. I didn't take  living in the tailpipe. I can't take that to work. I have no single instincts. I  know too much to be single. I know everything that happens now. That's no  good for single. You got to be optimistic to be single. Stupid. You  have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means you know. It means  stupid. An optimist somebody goes hey maybe something nice will happen. Why  the fuck would anything nice ever happen? What are you stupid? But that's the  attitude you have to be to be single. You have to look at something and go  ooh maybe. Look at it that way. Even when I see something I'm attracted to. I was at a gym  the other day. Why? Why? I'm at a gym. I'm just I'm just wearing shorts. That's  all I'm doing there. Just standing there. And I look over and there's a  girl on the you know with a ponytail and she's on this thing and I'm  looking at her and I'm like she's awesome. But then I start thinking  wait I'm single. I'm on the market. I have value. I could say something to  her. I could just walk up and say something and I'm trying to think what  am I gonna say? What do I look like to somebody like that? And then I",

her I don't know anybody like her and I am  so not a little old Chinese lady that I look I was like what are her  thoughts that was I was burning inside with what is she thinking right now  I can never know and I really the dumb brains telling me that she's just  thinking that's how dumb I am then I think Chinese gibberish that I made up  is in her actually Chinese mind that's all just me Chinese  person I can't know what she was thinking she could be thinking  anything black people steal so much she might I'm not saying they steal  I'm saying that fucking racist Chinese lady might have been thinking it she  possible and I went to England I spent a month there I liked England  everything's different I mean that's that's obvious but some of the  differences were cool I like the money the money instead of a dollar bill  they have the pound coin and it's a coin and you throw it on the counter  it felt kind of cool like the Old West like going to you know being on  the dusty trail you see a saloon so you walk over with your horse you  throw the rope vaguely at the pole outside thing they do well it's my whole  life on that horse should be fine walk in a saloon give me a beer bottle of  whiskey in a room for a week can steak dinner shave and a haircut the  bath some new clothes and a hat and some boots some oats from a horse and  woman here you go that's all one heavy coin you're fine nobody adds up all  those things you mentioned they don't check to see what coin it was the guy  just keeps drying the glass things were very vague back then things just  cost money hey how much is that money in the old English movies it was  different it was a little sack of coins remember that a little draw  string sack tossed over by some faggy lord with a ruffle shirt throw it  disdainfully down to some commoner who's gonna do some beneath his station  follow the girl and report back to me at midnight bring a shovel and a sack  and two reliable men such as yourself what's that oh yes of course well  this ought to be sufficient thank you sir so happy to get a general  amount of some kind of currency or another you didn't like count it I  think you only gave me enough for the shovel is not enough there that was a  good time in our economy when you needed to have gold to buy shit we  might be going back to that pretty soon too things are pretty fucked up  people a little bit scared but you know what how bad could it really get  I mean most Americans have so much crap you could lose most of it and  still be have more shit than the average Canadian even like we're the  fattest people in the world and we just have all this shit and we hate it  we're just miserable with our phones and I worry about the economy failing  because we don't we can't even worry miserable with a great life like I  don't know how the fuck we're gonna deal with like when you got to move  your mom into the cellar and shit and like have like serious problems  because we have like up till now we have white we have white people  that's what we have white people problems you know what that is that's  where your life is amazing so you just make shit up to be upset about  people in other countries have real problems like oh shit they're cutting  off all our heads today things like that we make shit up to be upset  about like how come I have to choose a language on the ATM machine it's  bullshit I shouldn't have to do that American shit we bitch about I  called American Airlines and I got a Pakistani lady and she was in Pakistan  only people near my fat white body should have jobs I'll tell you what  though when I call American Airlines and I get the Pakistani lady I hang up  and I call again I do I'm gonna tell you honestly and it's not because I  don't like her and it's not because she doesn't speak English because she  speaks way better than I do she's just a better person it's so clear  and I know here's why I don't like talking her because I know she doesn't  give a shit about me and my white people problems I want to talk to the  lady from Texas who's a will help you that's the lady I want I just know  that hello a medicate oh fuck you don't care

I got a dog last year. She's a great dog. I did not adopt her  I'll tell you be honest. I bought her with money  That's the truth  People always ask me when I walk my dog in new yorker. That's a beautiful dog. Is she a rescue?  I'm like, no, she's very expensive. Please don't touch her",

You're doing great  This is important to me  You ever look at your mom and go like mom how many dicks just how many  I lost my mom. So those are the things I don't know. So i'm curious  I don't feel like a lot of dudes fuck my mom  Not because she's like pure because I just I don't think so but  I hope it was as many as she wanted. That's what I hope  I hope she got all the dicks she ever dreamed of because I loved her  I hope at the end my mom was like that was plenty of dicks  But i'll never know because you don't know your mom. That's the truth  You don't really know your mother you feel like you know her but you know what she told you  She didn't tell you shit  You don't tell your kids your life. What did your mother tell you? I won a swimming medal when I was 12  She didn't tell you like I used to fuck this guy at work. It was amazing  She didn't tell you that think about your mom's  Life story as she told it to you. There's huge holes in that story  Well, I graduated when I was 22 and then I met your father when I was 35  Feels like a lot of dicks would fit right in there mom  You know those movies where you're where a mother and a daughter switch bodies  You ever seen a movie like that's always like freaky fridays some disney comedy  Where a mother and a daughter switch bodies and then they're like, whoa then they have to water ski and be in a rock band  together  And then they switch back and they know each other better. That's the formula  I think they should make another one of those movies  But it should be about a mother who switches bodies with her son  But it's not a comedy it's a drama  Like a medical affliction. They're upset the whole time  She's in the bathroom in the morning. I'm holding my son's penis. It's confusing  And her son is in her body. He's like, I don't want to be my mommy anymore  I don't like how it feels",
