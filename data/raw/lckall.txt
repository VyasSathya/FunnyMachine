[indistinct chatter] 
-- Louis! 
-- Louis! 
[indistinct chatter] 
[cheering] 
Alright, let's get started. 
Go ahead, sit down. 
Okay, yes, sit down, 
we're just starting. 
There's no opening act. 
Fuck it. Just, let's start. 
Let's just start. 
Get your seats. 
Get your beers and everybody 
go ahead, sit down. 
Kill the house lights. 
Let's just start. 
Let's just start a show. 
There's no point in 
screwing around. 
I'll do all the anouncements 
that you would have heard. 
Please turn off your cell phones. You can take pictures but 
turn off the flash. 
That's stupid, 
because it's not-- 
You know when you're watching the World Series and there's all that-- Like your flash is lighting 
Yankee Stadium. 
Just leave your flash off. 
Don't yell out during the show. If you have something you 
want to say to me... 
This is what we do. 
We write it down 
and then you go 
outside in the lobby 
and then you go home and 
you kill yourself 
because, that's selfish. 
This is a rhetorical performance. It's got nothing to do with you. 
Page 2/40
Don't text or twitter during 
the show. Just live your life. Don't keep telling people 
what you're doing. 
Just, because also-- 
also-- 
it lights up your big 
dumb face. It lights it up. 
I see this beautiful see of 
darkness and then just one guy. So, don't do that. 
What else? No jews, 
I think they said that earlier. They told me I have to say it. Jews aren't allowed. 
If you're jewish this 
is a good time to go. 
If you see somebody kind of Jewey looking then please tell an usher and they will-- 
Sir, come on. 
Let's go. Come on. 
Yes, let's go. 
But, I'm really glad you're here. This is a sizeable crowd. 
This is a big place. 
There's about 2500 people 
here, and that's-- 
That's a lot of people. 
That's enough people to be 
a sample of the population. 
you're all going to experience-- There's enough people here to 
say that within two months 
at least one of you will die. 
I'm just saying. I think it's 
probably accurate to say 
that out of any random 
group of 2500 people 
not all of you are gonna make 
it to Christmas, unfortunately. There's gonna be-- 
At least one of you here tonight is going to ruin your 
Page 3/40
family's Christmas 
by dying a shitty death. 
And I don't know 
who it is, I'm sorry. 
I don't know, your 
death is whatever-- 
Some people, they want you to do things when they die with their-- "I want you to take my 
ashes and sprinkle--" 
Fuck you, I'm not doing 
none of that shit. 
You're dead. 
I'm not going to run errands 
for you after you're dead. 
You don't matter anymore. 
Some people try to do something noble with their bodies. 
They try to have their bodies 
have some use after they're dead, which I think is a good thought. You're only borrowing your body. You're only borrowing everything. If you're body's worth anything when you're done with it 
you should pass it on. 
That's something I really believe. I mean, I'm not going 
to do it, because 
I don't want--eew--it's mine. 
I don't want-- 
I have a lot of beliefs 
and I live by none of them. 
That's just the way I am. 
They're just my beliefs. 
I just like believing them. 
I like that part. 
They're my little believies. 
They make me feel good 
about who I am. 
But if they get in the 
way of a thing I want 
or I want to jack off or 
something, I fucking do that. 
Page 4/40
But-- 
But some people take their-- 
my grandma, uh, grandmother 
She--just, uh, for the layman-- My grandmother, 
she gave her body to 
a medical school 
for it just to be 
examined and disected, 
which is a good thought for that. But you know her survivors 
are--her family--- 
That was a person. 
That was my grandmother. 
She used to wear glasses 
and say things. 
And now she's just shaved 
head on a metal table 
with a hungover medical student trying to dig our her pancreas. And he gets an "F". 
Imagine being the body where 
the kid got an "F" on you. 
The teacher's like, 
"No, you idiot." 
And he writes "F" on her tit 
with a Sharpie and just 
throws her down a shoot 
on a pile of "F" bodies. 
So, I don't care about her. 
[shout from audience] Louis! 
Shut up, idiot. 
Just shut your fucking mouth. 
Didn't you hear me before? 
Okay, so what am I going to do with my body. I'm going to die and I have to tell people 
what to do with my remains. 
I have an idea for something 
to do with my body 
or for other people to do with it, that will do good in the world. It doesn't exist yet 
as an institution 
Page 5/40
but I'm gonna create it, 
starting with my body. 
What it is, it's a place 
where you can go 
and be with a dead body 
and you just do 
whatever you want. 
And-- 
the point of this 
is that there are people out there who have sexual compulsions 
and they can't control them 
and so they go and they 
bother alive people. 
And with this you get it 
out of your system. 
This is the deal. 
You go in the room. 
There's nobody else with you. 
You've got 90 minutes. 
You just do whatever you 
want, whatever it is. 
Shit in my mouth. 
You want to-- 
Stick my toe in your pussy. 
Piss on my face. 
Whatever is the thing you gotta do. Jack off with the cartilage of my ear. Whatever is your heart's desire. I want to be the Willy Wonka 
for perverts. 
[singing] You can come on my back and pretend that I'm your father. [singing] I am dead, I don't mind. Sexual perversion is a problem. You can't stop it. 
People gotta do what they gotta do. This country is pretty perverted. We have to jack off to everything. There's not sex and then everything. Sex is in everything. 
You watch the news and 
there's a woman telling you, 
"And in Libya..." 
Page 6/40
Yeah tell me about Libya. 
Fucking tell me about Libya. 
Say, "Libya" again. 
Come on, fucking right up to 
the screen, on my flatscreen. 
Come on, say, "Libya" again. 
[grunting] 
It should just be a person, 
"In Libya..." or whatever. 
Why does it all have 
to be so sexualized? 
And music, every 
musician is attractive. 
Isn't that a weird coincidence that everyone who can play 
music also looks good? 
I would have thought there'd 
be one ugly guy with a guitar 
who would be amazing. 
But, fucking zero. 
And there's teen pop idols 
who are children. 
And they're on TV going-- 
It's a kid 
and folks are jacking off to them. "Folks." 
Just "Folks" are jacking off. 
[singing] Well, folks are jacking off to the girls on TV. 
Some of them are really young. I don't know their names. 
I don't have that 
knowledge anymore. 
I'm too old. 
When I think of a teen idol, 
there's Britney Spears. 
Because she's my age now. 
That's how long ago that was. 
She caught up to me. 
When I was 35, she was 18. 
And now we're both 44 years old. So that's how little I know about who these people are. 
I was thinking the other day, 
Page 7/40
what if there was a 
baby who was born 
and there's been a lot of fucked up babies, all kinds of babies born. There's been babies 
connected at the face, 
to a dog or whatever, 
babies with three legs, 
with hands on them. 
There's been 
Chinese babies. 
That's-- 
Okay, that's-- 
That's the worst thing I ever said. I think I just finally said 
the worst thing I have ever said. That was totally 
unredeeming and horrible. 
And it feels good. 
It feels good to have 
found bottom. 
There's a comfort in knowing 
that I just said the worst thing I'll ever say in the rest of my life. [exhaling] 
It's good. 
All right. 
Yeah, I'm not a good guy. 
I am not. 
I wish I was a good guy. 
I like the idea of being 
a good guy. 
Sometimes I have the opportunity to be a good guy and then I 
don't necessarily do it. 
I was on a plane once and 
I was flying first class, 
because I had a thing. 
I first class. 
Who cares? 
Just-- That's the way it is. 
I don't-- I'm not like you. 
I'm not. I'm not. 
All the things you do, I do a 
Page 8/40
better version of all those things. And-- 
It's only for another year at 
the most, believe me. 
It's not gonna last. 
It's been about eight months. 
I've got a year left and then I'm back to being just like you. 
But for now, it's pretty good. I'm in a first class seat and 
first class is so crazily better. It's so much better. 
You get a bigger seat. 
You get food. 
But also, you get to sit first. You get to sit before 
anybody else does. 
They sit you down and you get 
to just sit there with champagne and watch all the sweaty, 
miserable, 
all the single moms hefting 
their stroller and the kid. 
"That looks heavy and nobody's helping you. That's a drag." 
And you get to just-- 
Anyway, so I'm on the plane. 
I'm in first class 
and this soldier gets on the plane. I see soldiers fly all the time because that's how they 
get to the war. 
They fly on a shitty airline. 
You think they get to go on a 
cool green plane with a red light. "Go! Go! Go!" 
No, they just go to Delta. 
And they just 
wait in line to go to a war. 
And they always fly coach. 
I've never seen a soldier in 
first class in my life. 
It could be a full bird colonel, he's between two fat 
Page 9/40
guys in coach. 
And they're always nice. 
I've never seen a soldier 
get on a plane-- 
"Hey, I'm in the Army." 
"Fuck you. I have a gun." 
They're always, "Oh, yes sir. 
Thank you very much ma'am." 
It's like having an extra flight attendant. They help everybody put their shit up. They're awesome. 
And every time that I see a 
soldier on a plane, I always think, You know what, 
I should give him my seat. 
It would be the right thing to do. It would be easy to do and it 
would mean a lot to him. 
I could go up to him, "Hey, Son." I get to call him, "Son." 
"Hey, son, go ahead 
and take my seat." 
Because I'm in first class, why, 
for being a professional asshole. I'm in first class because I talk about babies with big dicks. 
That's what got me my seat. 
This guy is giving his life 
for the country, he thinks, 
and so he has to sit-- 
But that's good enough. 
That's good enough, 
the fact that he thinks it. 
I'm serious. 
He's fucking told by everybody 
in his life system 
that that's a great thing 
to do and he's doing it. 
And it's scary but he's doing it. And he's sitting in this shitty seat and I should trade with him. 
I never have. 
Let me make that clear. 
I've never done it once. 
Page 10/40
I've had so many opportunities. I never even really, 
seriously came close. 
And here's the worst part. 
I still just enjoy the fantasy for myself to enjoy. 
I was actually proud of myself for having thought of it. 
I was proud. 
Ah, I am such a sweet man. 
That is so nice of me 
to think of that and then 
totally never do it. 
At least you should be good 
just to the people-- 
Just turn a good face to the 
people that you see in life. 
I don't do that either 
because when I get in the 
elevator in my building-- 
That's my first contact 
with human beings after 
being home and just being 
disgusting for hours. 
Then I come out of the elevator and there's always a guy on 
the elevator who's nice. 
And I hate it. 
I get really upset when people say nice things to me. 
That's not a good impulse. 
I get in the elevator and there's always this one guy who just-- He sticks his face right in the front of his fucking head. 
"Hi!" He just floats it out 
there like a big balloon. 
"Hey, how's it going?" 
I get upset. 
I get cagey. 
I get this weird impulse that 
I want to come on his face. 
I don't know why that's the thing, but that's what I think about. 
Page 11/40
I wish I could just secrete come without the sexual workup, 
like as a defense, 
like a squid or a skunk. 
Not sexually. I mean agressively. "Hi!" 
[spurt] 
"Jesus, man." 
"You just came in my eye." 
I just want to go downstairs. 
I don't want to talk. 
Alright, this is going a little off the rails. I don't remember what I was trying to say. 
I'd like to be a better person. I would. 
I'd like to be a better person. And I think I'm getting 
worse as a person. 
Because as you get older 
you start finding out-- 
Let me give you an example. 
I rented a car a couple weeks 
ago, in Los Angeles 
I had the car for a few days 
and then when I went home I had to drop the car at the rental place. You gotta go to the rental place that's off the airport, 
give them the car, give them 
your thing with the mileage. 
You gotta get on a bus and then go to your terminal and check in. I was late and I was worried 
about missing my flight. 
So I knew I had no time 
to do any of that. 
So I just 
--I never did this before-- 
I just drove my car 
right to the terminal 
and just left it there. 
Then I got on the plane. 
Once I got on the plane and 
Page 12/40
had a moment I called 
Hertz and I said, 
Hey, listen, your car is sitting out in front of terminal four 
and the keys are in it. 
So, that's where it is." 
And the guy's like, 
"You can't do that." 
"You have to return it to 
the location and then get--" 
Well, I didn't do that already, and now I'm leaving California. So if you want your car you need to go to that place where it is. And he was like, 
"Awww, Jesus man." 
"Well, alright. We'll get it." And he-- That was the end of it. And I realized I could 
do this every time, 
every time I rented a car. 
Because of course they want 
you to do all that shit. 
But if you don't they 
still want the car back. 
They're going to send a dude. 
You could drive a car until 
you don't want it. 
Just get out of it while it's 
moving and just walk away. 
No, I don't feel like being 
in that car any longer. 
Just call Hertz. 
Hi, your car is drifting into the intersection of 28th and Broadway, if you're interested. 
It's now your problem. 
But see, this is a 
terrible realization 
because you should act in a way that if everybody acted that 
way things would work out. 
You should, because it would be mayhem if everybody was like that. 
Page 13/40

And most people kind of don't care. Most people are very selfish. 
Most people don't give 
a shit what happens 
as long as they get to 
do their favorite thing. 
People don't even want to back off from their favorite thing. They won't even do their 
second favorite thing. 
You ever seen somebody in trouble, like they're at an intersection and they want to make a left, 
but they're in the right-- 
the all the way right lane 
because they messed up. 
So, here's the guy. 
He's in the right lane. 
And there's a lot cars, 
like 6th avenue. 
A lot of cars. 
And he wants to make that left. So what does he do? 
He just does it anyway. 
He just goes at it. 
He just shoves his car 
through everybody's life 
without any-- 
And everybody's honking and 
outraged and you always 
see they guy go, 
"I have to. I have to." 
"There's no other possible 
thing I could do." 
"What else could I do, except 
go up one more block 
and then go left and 
take four seconds." 
"That's not my favorite way, though!" "That only meets 99% of my criteria." But I'm selfish. 
I would like to be a better person, because I have kids. 
And I want to pass on a better-- Page 14/40

Sometimes it's not clear what 
the right thing is to do. 
One time I threw a candy 
wrapper on the street. 
I didn't do it like, "Yeah!" 
I just-- 
Yeah, take that shit, street. 
I did it because I was shaking. I wanted the candy. 
Anyway, I was with a friend 
who said to me, "You just littered on the street. Don't you care 
about the environment?" 
And I thought about it and I said, You know what, this 
isn't 'The Environment'. 
This is New York City. 
This is not 'The Environment'. 
This is where people live. 
New York City is not the environment. New York City is a giant piece of litter. It's the giantest, next to Mexico City, the shittiest piece of litter in the world. 
Just a pussy, runny, smoking, 
stinking piece of litter. 
So if you have a piece of litter, what are you supposed 
to do with it? 
You should throw it 
on the pile of litter. 
Because if you don't, 
if you put it in a receptacle 
then it gets collected and 
it gets taken to a dump 
and a landfill and then 
it goes on a boat. 
And it goes out and gets 
dumped in the ocean and 
some dolphin wears it 
as a hat on its face 
for ten years, this hat that 
never dissolves, on its face. 
Ugh. 
Page 15/40
Jesus. 
[dolphin clicking] 
Everything that we introduce 
to the world is shitty... 
...meaning white people. 
Because-- 
I really think that white people 
are from another planet 
because when we came to 
America, it was so nice. 
It was just Indians. 
And they weren't even Indians. 
We called them that by accident. 
And we still call them that. 
We knew in a month 
that it wasn't Indians 
but we just don't give a shit. 
We never correct it. 
We came here. 
They're like, "Hi." 
And we're like, 
"Hey, you're Indians, right?" 
And they're like, "No." 
"No, this is India, right?" 
"No, it's not. It's a totally other place." "You're not Indians?" 
"No." 
"Ahh, you're Indians." 
"You're Indians for hundreds 
of years after." 
We ruined everything here. 
This was the great-- 
It was just coast-to-coast 
green, brown and beautiful. 
And all the humans were 
just walking around 
with painted faces, 
just walking. 
And they'd be like, 
"Oh, that looks yummy." 
And they'd just eat from the ground. And then they'd sleep on the grass. And they'd wake up and they'd fuck. And then they'd go for a swim 
Page 16/40
and do a little dance. 
That was the whole continent, 
just folks doing that. 
I mean there was people in 
Mexico cutting off kids' heads and rolling them down 
the pyramid stairs. 
But that's-- 
I mean... 
That's always going on. 
You know-- 
You can't do a whole 
lot about that. 
But I think we came 
from another planet 
and the reason is we 
don't like it here. 
Why, if we're from here, 
if we belong on Earth, 
why aren't we comfortable 
on Earth, at all? 
We need nice smooth surfaces 
and right angles and we 
need it to be cool 
and not too hot, just a 
little dit-dit just perfect. 
Why wouldn't, when it's hot, 
why wouldn't we just-- 
"Yeah, fuck it." 
Why wouldn't we be like 
that if we belonged here? 
And it's weird because 
people that are-- 
You know, there's 
environmentalists 
and there's people who 
just hate environmentalists. 
People get angry 
at environmentalists 
because they think they're 
slowing down the economy 
and creating restrictions and a lot of these people are Christian. A lot of these people are 
Page 17/40
very devout Christians 
and that's such a 
confusing thing to me, 
that if you believe that 
God gave you the Earth, 
that God created Earth for you, why would you not 
have to look after it? 
Why the fuck-- 
Why would you not think that when he came back he wouldn't go, 
"What the fuck did you do?" 
"I gave this to you, motherfucker. Are you crazy?" 
"The polar bears are brown." 
"What did you do to the polar bears?" "Did you shit all over 
every polar bear?" 
"What did you--who did this? 
Who spilled this shit? 
Who spilled this?" 
"Come over here. Did you 
fucking spill this? What is that?" "It's oil. It's just some oil. I didn't mean to spill--" 
"Well why did you take it 
out of the fucking ground?" 
"Because I wanted to go faster." "I'm not fast enough." 
"And I was cold." 
"What the fuck do you mean, 'cold'?" "I gave you everything you 
needed, you piece of shit." 
"Well, because jobs, and I wanted--" "What is a job? Explain to me, what's a fucking job?" 
"Well, like you work at a 
place and people call 
when their game doesn't work 
and you help them figure it out." "What do you do that for?" 
"For money." 
"What do you need money for?" 
"Food." 
Page 18/40
"Just eat the shit on the floor." "I left shit all over the floor." "Fucking corn and wheat and shit. Grind it up, make some bread. 
What are you doing?" 
"Yeah, but it doesn't have, 
like, bacon around it." 
"And like-- I like when it 
has bacon on it." 
I watched somebody do that the 
other day after a meal they went, "Oh, it was just--" 
And I started wondering, 
what does that mean? 
What does that signify? 
I think what it means is that you ate something so delicious 
that you then kissed 
somebody on the asshole 
and their asshole exploded. 
That's some good eating. 
That's a nice sauce. 
"Is that good?" 
"Yeah, let me show you." 
"Shit. Let me have some of that." That just destroyed my anus. 
Anyway, I got kids and 
that's sort of what I'm trying to say. It's hard having kids 
because it's boring. 
That really is the hardest 
part of having kids. 
Ask any parent, What's the hard part? Is it looking after their health care? Is it making sure that their education-- No, it's being with them on the floor while they be children. 
It's just-- 
They read Clifford the 
Big Red Dog to you 
at a rate of 50 minutes a page. And you have to sit there 
and be horribly proud and bored at the same time. 
Page 19/40
I hate Clifford the Big Red Dog. I hate him. 
There's 50 books about 
Clifford the Big Red Dog. 
Fifty books. 
There's seven books about Narnia that cover the birth and death of a nation and mice with swords 
and a lion who's a god. 
They did it in seven books. 
Fifty books about 
Clifford the Big Red Dog, 
and they all tell the exact same story. Look how big this dog is. 
That's it. 
Look how big this dog is. 
That's the whole book. 
Here's how big he was at the firehouse. Here's how big he was at Thanksgiving. Who gives a shit? 
You just drew him big. 
You just, on purpose, made 
him bigger than people. 
It should be, "Look how big 
I drew the dog in this book." 
"Isn't that a mistake?" 
There's no story. 
You maybe even just drew him 
closer to the page. I don't even know if you did it honestly. 
Tell a story about Clifford. 
Make something happen, where 
maybe he steps on a policeman 
and shatters his spine and it's 
devastating to the community. 
He hangs on for two months and then dies. And there's a whole, you know, 
funeral with bagpipes and 
everybody's crying. 
And Clifford gets the death penalty. There's a whole book about 
his appeal process and how 
he found Jesus but everybody 
said it was bullshit. 
Page 20/40

The cop's wife was like, 
"I want that dog dead!" 
And then he goes to the chair 
and they shave all his red 
fur off and now he's 
Clifford the Big Pink Dog. 
Put him on a big funny electric chair that the town got 
together and built. 
It's boring having kids. 
You gotta play kid games. 
You gotta play board games, 
little kid board games where you-- And then you go dit-dit-dit 
You got a six, honey. 
One. 
Two. 
Three. 
It's just here. Just go here. It's just-- Daddy, I'm learning. 
I know. You're going to grow up stupid because I'm bored. I 
can't take it, baby. I can't. 
I can't watch it. 
I'm bored more than I love you. I can't. I just-- 
Come on. 
My girls are six and nine now. 
They're actually a really exciting age because they're learning 
to do some cool stuff. 
I played Monopoly with my kids. That's really fun. 
My nine year old, she can 
totally do Monopoly. 
The six year old actually totally gets how the game works 
but she's not emotionally 
developed enough 
to handle her inevitable loss 
in every game of Monopoly. 
Because, a Monopoly loss is dark. It's heavy. 
It's not like when you lose at Candyland. Page 21/40

Oh, you got stuck in the fudgey thing, baby. Oh, well. 
You're in the gummy twirly-ohs 
and you didn't get to win. 
But when she loses at Monopoly I gotta look at her little face and go, Okay, sweetie, here's what's 
gonna happen now, okay? 
All your property, 
everything you have, 
all your railroads, your houses, all your money, 
that's mine now. 
Gotta give it all to me. 
No, give it to me. That's right. No, no you can't play 
anymore, see, because 
even though you're giving me all of that it doesn't even touch how 
much you owe me. 
It doesn't even touch it, baby. You're going down hard. It's really bad. All you've been working for all day, I'm going to take it now 
and I'm going to use it to 
destroy your sister. 
I mean, I'm going to ruin her. 
It's just mayhem on this 
board for her now. 
When you have kids you also have to belong to kid and parent culture. You have to know a lot of parents and a lot of other kids. 
You have to hang out 
with other kids. 
Sometimes they're not 
even kids you know. 
When I go to parks with my 
kids, I play with them. 
I play with my kids. 
Some people don't do that. 
They just take their kids to the park so they don't have to talk to them, and those kids kind of 
Page 22/40
glom on to our shit. 
I'll be sitting at the park playing 
a fun game with my kids 
and there's this woman on a 
bench. She's got her phone 
and she's just staring at her phone. 
And her kid's like, "Mommy, talk to me." 
"Leave me alone. I'm trying to cheat on your father! Stop it!" And then the kid comes up to us, 
"Can I be in your family?" 
It's creepy. 
One time I was at a swimming 
pool with my kids, a public pool. 
I had my daughter, my six 
year old, on my arm like this. 
She was like clamped on, and 
she's kicking. It was so much fun. 
And then she got off and another 
random child just clamped on. 
It's like a rat. Get off of me. 
"But I love you." 
I don't know you, kid. Stop. 
I think that kid's dead. I don't 
know what happened. 
Some kids in my kid's class, 
I like some of those kids. 
Some of those kids are cool. They 
come over to my house and they 
play with my--I like them. 
Other kids I don't like, 
especially the little boys. 
Little boys in my kid's class, 
I hate them. I hate little boys. 
I'm like the opposite of a 
pedophile. I just hate-- 
There's one kid in my daughter's 
class who I hate so much, 
and it's really fucked up because I'm 44 
and I hate a six year old. 
I mean, I hate him 
with a grown-up, pre-occupying hate. 
I've thought about him three 
times since I came out here. 
That's how much I really hate this kid. 
Page 23/40
I'm going to tell you about him and I have to make up a name 
because he's a real child 
who lives in this city, so I have to make up a name in order to 
tell this story about him. 
His name is just, Jezanthepuss. Let's just call him Jezanthepuss. Jezanthepuss. Fine. 
Okay. 
He's in my daughter's class. 
They're in first grade. 
When we take our kids to class, there's a little procedure. 
You bring your kid to school and they have their backpack 
and their jacket 
and they go to their cubby 
and take it all off and they 
put it in the cubby. 
Then they take their homework 
folder and their lunchbox 
and put them in the bins. 
Those are their little responsibilities. You help them do it so 
they'll, blah blah blah. 
But, Jezanthepuss-- 
When he comes in he doesn't 
do none of that shit. 
He just walks in and just sheds it all. And his mom, his weak, piece of shit mom picks it all up. 
I hate his mother 
because you hate a weak 
parent, when you're a parent. 
Because it's like you're raising Hitler, motherfucker. Do your job! Get in there. 
If our parent group and our class were a platoon of soldiers, 
she'd be the one that we'd 
put soap bars in socks and-- 
We'd frag that bitch in her sleep. She would wash right the fuck out. 
Page 24/40
She wouldn't make it. 
When Jezanthepuss drops his shit, this bitch picks it up. 
She just goes, 
"He just... I'll get..." 
"I'll get it..." 
"And then I'll put it in the bins for him." And she puts it all away for him, which frees him up to punch 
other kids in the face 
because he's a shitty, 
horrible, violent child. 
One time I was at school, 
and I was volunteering at recess. It's something you do, you know, 
if you're a good parent, 
about once a month 
or whatever it is. 
You go to school 
and you just stand there 
and you watch recess. 
You masturbate, whatever 
you want to do. 
That is now the worst thing. 
That's the worst thing. 
Now that's the worst thing I 
ever said. Okay. Alright. 
We'll find it. 
I mean you could. It's a public 
school nobody would even give a shit. But, I haven't thus far. 
It hasn't gotten that bad. 
Anyway, I'm watching recess 
and recess is a trip. 
If you've never been to recess, 
it's intense because it's 
like the universe. 
You know if you watch the ocean crash, waves on the beach for a long time, you start feeling like you're 
understanding how everything works. That's what recess is like, because every natural, chaotic energy 
is represented at recess. 
Page 25/40

There's kids swirling around in 
these big roiling crazy things. 
There's one kid just spazzing 
out just to some singularity kid. It's a binary system of two 
kids holding hands 
and they're running and just 
clotheslining every child 
of a certain height. 
They're keeping a uniform 
height to the playground. 
So I'm watching recess 
and I see Jezanthepuss. 
And he's walking with this evil-- This kid is like evil stuck out of time. He's like-- 
I always picture him in a gray 
fur coat with bones in it, 
and lots of rings from people 
that he killed, and just walking. And then I see my daughter and 
she's standing there, just by herself. And there's Jezanthepuss and 
I know he's going for her. 
It was like an action movie thriller thing. And I think to myself, I gotta go there and I gotta protect her. 
But then I thought, let him do 
a little something first. 
Let him do just a little something, because I want this kid in my life. I want a reason. 
I want aerial photos of him 
doing some shit to my family 
that I can bring to the U.N. 
and get authority to waterboard 
this little motherfucker. 
I want to-- 
I want to get him on a 
flight to Venezuela 
with an envelope on his head 
and duct tape and all that shit. 
So, anyway, he goes for her, 
grabs her arm, starts twisting it. Page 26/40

She goes, "Ahhh!" 
I run over. I'm just knocking kids over. I run, grab him. 
I look in his little face and I go, Listen to me, Jezanthepuss. 
If you ever, 
ever, in your life, 
touch her again-- 
And as I'm doing this I realize this is not cool that doing this. This is totally inappropriate. 
It's really wrong. 
It's way over the top. 
It's too grown up. 
It's like he's a drug dealer in my building that I finally fucking-- "This ends now, motherfucker 
or I will cut you. I don't care." And he's-- 
He starts crying pitifully. 
And I just, I really did this, I just walked away from him. I just got away. And then all the teachers-- 
everybody gathers around. 
Jezanthepuss, what's wrong with you? And he's like-- 
And he couldn't articulate it 
because he's not getting educated. Fuck him. 
I was there going, Yeah, you could have told on me bitch, 
but you're too stupid now, 
which is your own fault, 
you future ditchdigging piece of shit. Oh, I'm going to love watching you grow up into nothing, motherfucker. I'm gonna watch it. 
I'm gonna fuck your mom 
and not call her too. 
I'm gonna ruin her summer. 
I'm gonna fuck your mom twice 
and then never call her. 
I don't know your dad because he ran out on you, but I'm gonna find him. 
Page 27/40
I'm gonna turn myself gay and 
then I'm going to fuck him too. 
I'm gonna fuck-- 
I'm gonna suck his dick so good 
that he just has to change 
his whole life. 
And I'm gonna move into a place with him in the village for a couple 
of months and totally-- 
He'll cut off ties to all his life and start wearing cut-offs 
that are really tight. 
And he'll just-- 
And then I'll go to some Christian turn-you-not-gay place. 
And then I'll come back and go, 
"What's wrong with you faggot?" 
Make him feel bad inside, 
like what has he done. 
But you gotta protect your 
kids, you know. You gotta. 
You gotta protect your kids. 
You gotta do it, man. 
A lot of people will talk the talk. A lot of people say that shit. 
"I would throw myself under a bus for my--" Oh, yeah, would you fuck another kid's dad, and confuse him sexually, 
and yourself sexually in the process, and use homophobia that you 
hate, against another person, 
just because some kid shoved 
your kid for a second? 
That's my baby girl. I gotta do it, son. I gotta suck that dick. 
That's my baby girl. 
I gotta do it for her. 
Alright. 
Alright. 
Alright, I hate that child. 
That's what I'm trying to say. 
I've been thinking about my 
memories because I have kids now. And my kids are at an age 
Page 28/40
where I remember being their age. I remember being a six year old. 
I remember being a nine year old. And that's a big threshold 
that my kids have crossed, 
that I remember being their age. 
Because when you're raising kids, you're not raising the kid in front of you. You're raising the grown up 
that they're going to be later. 
And I was a kid once. 
When they were babies, I didn't really relate to them because they're babies. A baby is not going to remember shit that is happening to it. 
If you have a baby, keep it 
alive and enjoy yourself. 
But really, the baby doesn't-- 
It's not going to matter. 
A baby is not accumulating anything. It's like an Etch A Sketch 
that you shake every day. 
It doesn't really-- 
It doesn't matter. 
You could go up to your baby's face every day and say, "Fuck you, baby." every day and it wouldn't matter. Hey, baby! 
You could do that every day 
and it wouldn't matter. 
I mean, they'll grow up with 
a general sadness inside. 
But they won't-- 
They won't actually remember why. And memories are weird because memories get distorted by who you are now 
and who you were when 
you experienced them. 
I remember when I first 
started doing stand-up. 
I was living in Boston and there was one club that was owned by a gay guy. And my memory is that that guy 
was always trying to fuck me. 
Page 29/40
That's my memory. 
I've carried it for 20 years. 
There was a gay guy who 
tried to fuck me all the time. 
And recently I caught up with an old friend of mine from those days, 
who I hadn't seen in years. 
And we started talking about different people and he brought him up. 
And I said, "That guy always 
used to try to fuck me." 
And he goes, "He did?" 
And I was like, "Yeah." 
And he goes, 
"Really? Did he--" 
"I mean, did he like take you 
to his house or something 
and really try to physically..." 
No, it's just that, you know what I mean. He was trying to fuck me all the time." And he was like, "Well did he 
say-- Did he push you-- 
and say stuff all the time 
and make you uncomfortable?" 
No, it just was-- 
And as we went through it, 
the truth came out. 
The whole story really was, 
there once was a gay man. 
That's it. 
That's really what happened. 
He was gay. 
I was 19. 
And now, "He tried to fuck me all the time." I went through life with that. 
But I've been trying to 
remember my first memory. 
How far do my memories go? 
And I remembered my first memory. 
I was four years old. 
I was standing in front of my parents' house and I was shitting in my pants. 
I was just shitting a massive, 
terribly painful shit. 
Page 30/40
And I was half way through the shit. 
That's my first memory, being half way-- The first half of the shit, I don't remember it. That's still in the ether of infancy. The center of this shit was so wide 
that I actually came online as a result of the anal pain that I was experiencing. It actually awakened me 
--Yee-aahhh-- 
into the stream of consciousness 
that I'm now living. 
That's how my life started. That's who I am. A lot of my memories I don't like. 
I don't like-- When I was a 
teen-ager I hated all that time. 
I hated being a teen-ager, 
and then I discovered drugs. 
And then that's all I gave a shit about. I don't know how I'm gonna tell my kids. How the fuck do you compete with that. How do you take a miserable person 
with no control over their lives 
and tell them with a straight face, 
Uh, You can't do drugs. 
You can't do that, baby. 
All drugs are, are a perfect solution to every problem you have right now. 
How do you beat that? 
Drugs are so fucking good 
that they'll ruin your life. 
That's how good they are. 
I can't do drugs now because I'm 44 
and I can't hook it up. 
I can't make that happen. 
If you're 44 and you want to get 
high, you gotta hurt your back. 
That's pretty much the 
only option you have. 
Hurt your back, get some Percoset. 
And then get a babysitter 
and take three at a diner. 
Just, sad. 
I'm a little drowsy, woooo! 
I never really could have-- 
Page 31/40
I wish I was a drunk. 
I love romantically the idea 
of being a real drunk, 
in my bathrobe all day. 
Everybody who love's me is always 
crying. "He's destroying himself. 
I can't watch anymore." 
Shut up then. 
Showing up at my kids school 
play half way through. 
"You show 'em who you are, baby." 
I wish I could be that guy. 
But I can't drink because I just get tired. I go to sleep. 
I don't know how people 
drink and then do shit. 
When I see movies or TV shows 
where there's people in an office 
having a power meeting and they're --clink clink-- 
They're making a drink in 
the daylight with a tie on. 
"Well, Senator, I hope you play ball with us on this construction deal, 
if you know what I'm saying." 
"Yeah, we'll see what's in it for me." How is the next scene not all those people just lying on the floor going, "Oh, fuck" "I can't believe I drank whiskey at noon." I can't smoke pot because-- It's the same thing. I'm too old for it. 
Sometimes young people come 
up to me after shows. 
"Hey, do you want to smoke some pot." I'm like, Can I get my portion to smoke without you, alone, later, because I don't want to stand in a parking lot with some twenty year-olds. 
Last time I got high I was in Kansas City. And I got high because I was 
in Kansas City. It was shitty. 
So after the show, 
these kids that worked at 
the club were like, "You 
Page 32/40
want to smoke some pot?" 
I'm like, "Yes." 
So, I'm standing in a 
parking lot with these kids, 
like 20 years old, and 
we're smoking a joint. 
And I'm taking huge hits 
because I had no idea. 
I didn't know they had been working on this shit like it's the cure for cancer. I didn't understand the fucking technology that's gone into making pot so powerful. Because when I was a kid you could just smoke a joint for a while. 
Now you take two hits and you go insane. It's not doable anymore. 
And I was taking big hits, like big 1970's, jean jacket, Bad Company hits. 
[singing] Here come the 
Jesters, one, two, three. 
[singing] It's all part of my fantasy. And I'm like, "Yeah" 
And even the kid with the wooden 
hole of no ear 
the absense of flesh in 
his ear, with wood. 
I don't know what that is. 
Even he was like, 
"You should be careful. That's a lot of pot. That's very strong marijuana." Yeah, I'm fine. 
[singing] "Running with the devil." And in about ten seconds, everything just-- And I'm like, "Oh, shit." 
This is an ordeal now. 
I'm not going to feel okay 
for a very long time. 
[sigh] 
And everybody's just standing 
around and talking. 
And I'm hoping, 
I'm really hoping, 
that I look like this. 
But I'm pretty sure 
Page 33/40
that I was just scanning insanely. I was actually counting. 
Look at her for five... 
four... 
three... 
two... 
...one. 
Switch to him. 
Five... 
four... 
three... 
...two. Randomize. Don't 
go in the same direction. 
Five... 
four... 
...three. Nod your head. That looks like you're listening if you nod your head. And at one point I realized, 
I need to get out of here, 
because the air is hitting my 
arm weirdly and they can tell. 
They totally know 
that I am not handling the way 
air is touching my arm right now. Why am I doing that with my hand. That's weird to do with your hand. Nobody stands like this. 
Nobody stands like this. 
Just fucking-- 
No, that's also-- 
That's weird too. 
That's crazy. 
Just-- 
Shit. 
I gotta go. 
But I didn't know how to leave, because I had this dilema. 
We're all standing in a perfect circle, facing each other. 
And I thought it's going to be 
insane if I just turn my-- 
I'm one person with my back now. Do I just back away like this 
and hope that they fill in? 
Page 34/40
And then I thought, no, say something. Say something out loud to them that smooths the transition of you leaving. Okay, what do I say? Pick a 
thing to say. Goodbye. 
That's a nightmare. 
That's just... 
Goodbye? 
That's not even-- that's just noises. Finally I walked away and 
I said, "I'm leaving!" 
I know it was that bad 
because they all went, "Whoa. 
Shit. Okay. Alright. Whoa." 
I'll never see those people 
again as long I live. 
And then I had to get in the car. 
I forgot that I had rented a car 
and I have to drive back to the hotel. And I'm driving on this highway in Missouri. And at one point I realized, 
I think it's been about 25 minutes since I had looked out the 
front window of this car. 
I've just been dealing 
with shit directly in-- 
Oh, shit. 
There's a whole spectrum of 
responsibility out here. 
I'm supposed to take part in this. And then at one point I remember 
I was at a drive through, 
and I was terrified. 
Because there's a lady sticking 
her head out a window. 
And she's mad. She's going, "Sir!" "Sirrr!" 
I just kept saying, 
I don't know. I don't know. 
I don't know! 
I had the window closed. 
I had no fucking idea. 
What part of the transaction am I--? Did I pay yet? Have I ordered? 
Page 35/40
Have I been sitting here for 
at the window, and I ate the 
paper and everything? 
"Sirrr!" 
And I just went, 
I don't know! I don't want it! And I just fucking bolted. 
So I can't do that anymore. 
But you get older and some 
things you can't do anymore. 
Some things you don't 
want to do anymore. 
It's a nice change. 
You feel some desires fall away. New things make you happy. 
But some things don't change 
and some things I'm sick of. 
Like the constant 
just the constant 
perverted, sexual thoughts. 
I'm so tired of those. 
Just the constant-- 
Suck it. 
It just makes me into an idiot. I'm jacking off to morons. 
"Look at my tits." 
Yeah, your tits are awesome. 
It's just a dumb part of 
life that I'm sick of. 
It's all day too. 
It's just-- 
You can't have a day. 
I just want to be a person in clothes walking in a store and just-- 
I just want to go to the 
library and ask for-- 
Hi, ma'am, is there-- I'm 
looking for a book about 
early Abraham Lincoln, 
like when he was-- 
I wish I could wrap your hair 
around my dick and-- 
Oh, shit. 
I'm trying to talk to her! 
Page 36/40
[sigh] 
That's really a male problem. 
It's really a male problem, not being able to control your constant sexual impulse. Women try to compete. 
"Well, I'm a pervert. You don't know." "I have really sick sexual thoughts." No, you have no idea. 
You have no idea. 
See, you get to have those thoughts. I have to have them. 
You're a tourist in sexual perversion. I'm a prisoner there. 
You're Jane Fonda on a tank. 
I'm John McCain in the hut. 
It's a nightmare. 
I can't lift my arms. 
And for men, sex just is 
such a constant thing. 
It's not even sex to us. It's just pussy. That's what we call it. 
Pussy... it has nothing to do with women. It's not about girls or chicks 
like it was in the 50's. 
There's no guys anywhere 
in the world saying, 
"Let's go meet some chicks and kiss them on the mouth and see what happens." There's none of that. 
"Mmmm, I sure would like to 
have my arm around a girl." 
"Mmmm, Vanessa, I love--" 
No, it's not. 
It's just 
pussy. 
Pussy. 
It's not even a pussy. 
It's not some peoples' pussies. 
It's just pussy. 
Like big pink balloon letters in front of our faces all the time. To men it's just an 
element of the universe, 
like it should be on the 
Page 37/40
chart of the elements 
next to tin and ammonia. 
P-y with an atomic weight of 12 
or whatever pussy atoms weigh. 
The sad thing is that for all our obsession about sex and how much we love it, we suck at it. 
Men are terrible at sex. 
It never even occurs to us to do it well. Women just make sex great. 
Women are the good part of sex. 
They accept the dick with grace 
and they turn it into art. 
Or they climb on and they ride. 
They go for a ride. 
Men don't. We just climb on. 
[grunting] 
I'm putting my dick in you. 
Put it in. 
Shove it in. 
Shove it. 
[grunting] 
You ever fuck when you're out of shape? You're like, "Ugh, shit. This is--" My stomach muscles are not strong. [grunting] 
We're so bad at sex 
and then we wonder why women 
aren't really aggressive about sex. We think it's because they don't 
have as much desire as we do. 
That's how stupid men are. 
We think they're just weird. 
"Women are fucked up in the head, because they don't want to 
just fuck all the time." 
"If I was a women, I'd 
just fuck everybody." 
"Why don't they want to 
fuck all the time? I do." 
Of course you do, because when 
you fuck, you get to fuck a woman. When she fucks, she has to fuck a guy. Wildly different experience. 
Page 38/40
For a man, 100% of the time 
he's fucking a woman 
it's the greatest thing that ever happened in his entire life. 
For a woman, about 40% of the time she's being fucked by a guy she's thinking, "I'll get over this in a week. 
It's not the worst thing." 
"I'm not going to cry this time." Another thing that proves how bad men are at sex is that after sex you're looking at two very different people. The man just wants to lay there and be cool and the woman 
wants to cuddle. 
It's something that men love 
to make fun of women for. 
"They always want to cuddle. 
It's so needy." 
"I already fucked you. 
Just let me watch the game." 
"I'm so cool." 
"What are you thinking about?" 
"Shut up. Leave me alone." 
"Why is she so needy?" 
She's not needy, you idiot. 
She's horny, because you 
did nothing for her. 
You did absolutely nothing. 
Her pussy is on fire 
because it's gone unfucked completely. Of course you're fine, because 
you climbed on and went-- 
and then rolled off. 
And she's on you because she's going, "What the--? Something 
else has to happen!" 
"This is bullshit!" 
If you fuck a woman well 
she will leave you alone. 
"Thanks a lot, buddy." 
[snoring] 
Thanks a lot, folks. 
I hope you enjoyed the show. 
Page 39/40
You guys were great. 
Thank you very very much. 
Good night.

Hello.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Um...
So, you know, I think abortion is, um...
I...
Here's what I think.
Here's what I... This is what I think.
Here's what I think. I...
I think you should not get an abortion
unless you need one.
In which case...
In which case, you'd better get one.
I mean, seriously.
If you need an abortion,
you'd better get one.
Don't fuck around.
And hurry.
Not getting an abortion
that you need is like not taking a shit.
That's how bad that is.
It's like not taking a shit.
That's what I think.
I think abortion is exactly like
taking a shit.
I think it is 100%
the exact same thing as taking a shit.
Or it isn't.
It is, or it isn't.
It's either taking a shit,
or it's killing a baby.
It's only one of those two things.
It's no other things.
If you didn't like hearing
it's like taking a shit,
you think it's killing a baby.
That's the only other one you get to have.
Which means you should be holding a sign
in front of the place.

Page 2/37

People hate abortion protesters.
They're so shrill and awful.
They think babies are being murdered.
What are they supposed to be like?
"Uh, that's not cool."
I don't wanna be a dick about it, though.
I don't want to ruin their day as they
murder several babies all the time.
I don't think it's killing a baby.
I don't.
I mean, it is, it's a little bit...
It's a little bit killing a baby.
It's a little bit...
It's 100% killing a baby.
It's totally killing a whole baby.
But I think that women should be allowed
to kill babies.
That's what I think.
They should be allowed to kill babies.
Yeah.
Whoo!
We get to kill babies!
Let's do some shots and kill some babies.
I killed like four babies last night.
It was fucking retarded.
It has to be one or the other.
You know, like, when people say,
abortion should be legal, safe and rare.
Why rare if it should be legal?
If it should be legal,
it's... It's shitting.
If it should be rare,
it's murdering babies.
But, again, women should be allowed
because...
Two reasons I think women
should be allowed to kill babies.
Number one,
I don't think life is that important.
It's just not.
It is not.
People get too excited...
about life. "Oh, life."
Fuck you. It's not that...

Page 3/37

Make a list of every shitty thing ever,
that's in life.
Life is okay. I like life.
I like it. I don't need it.
I'd be fine without it.
I like life, though. I do.
You know how much I like life?
I have never killed myself.
- That's how much I like it.
- Whoo!
That's exactly how much I like it,
with a razor-thin margin.
I like it precisely enough
to not kill myself.
It's an option, though.
It's totally an option.
I mean, I'm 49. I have two kids.
I've flipped through the brochure
a few times.
I've thought of killing myself just
to win an argument.
Not supposed to talk about suicide,
even to your shrink.
You ever go to a shrink and they're like,
"Have you had thoughts... of suicide?"
And you're like, "No, because
if I say yes, you'll press a button,
and folks will run in and hold me...
"Hold him down!"
You should talk about it.
The whole world is just made of people
who didn't kill themselves today.
That's who's here.
It's all of us that went,
"Okay, fuck it, keep doing it."
It's...
It's an interesting thing about life.
Life can get very difficult,
very sad, very upsetting.
But you don't have to do it.
You don't have to do it.
You don't have to do anything.
You never have to do anything
because you can kill yourself.

Page 4/37

If they send you a letter
from Motor Vehicles, come in and:
"No, I don't. I'll kill myself."
You can do that. You can do that once.
But you can do it.
It's interesting because even when life
gets bad, people choose it over nothing.
Even the worst versions of life,
even a shitty, shitty life,
is worth living, apparently.
'Cause folks are living the fuck out
of them.
Have you ever seen somebody, you're like,
"He should kill himself.
Why did he not... that dude..."
Ever been driving and you look
in the next car, you're like, "Ugh, shit.
I wish I hadn't looked in that car.
That was difficult to glance at...
let alone being it."
Just a guy in a...
In a tan car.
Nobody chooses tan.
Nobody picks tan for their car.
They give you tan.
"Is that mine?" "Yeah, it's yours,
fucking loser. Made it tan."
They shouldn't even make tan cars.
It's mean to make them.
You look over, you see a guy in a tan car
with dents all over it
and a garbage bag for a window.
What is holding up his suicide?
What is delaying it?
What is keeping him
from stopping being that?
And what would it take?
What would it take?
What would it take?
Both windows are garbage bags? Is that...?
Seriously, do you know how much misery
is involved in a garbage bag for a window?
Do you know how many separate moments
of shit misery?

Page 5/37

"They canceled my insurance.
I broke my window.
Duct tape."
Here's the truth. Running away will not
solve your problems. That's totally true.
But killing yourself solves
all your problems.
It actually does.
It even solves world's problems.
For you.
"Hey, what about ISIS?"
"Kill yourself.
Then they'll never get you."
Seriously,
if everybody who's afraid of ISIS
kills themselves right now,
then ISIS loses.
Because they live in a world of people
that don't give a shit.
"We're gonna cut his head off!"
"Yeah, okay."
"It's not fun now."
I think the worst part
of being beheaded...
If...
The worst thing about being beheaded
is that you look really dumb right after.
That's the worst part.
They go like that, and you're like:
"Duh."
Just that fucking dopey...
I don't think they like beheading
bald people 'cause they can't do this...
That's the best part.
They got to go like this.
It's not as cool.
So, just shave the top of your head,
and you won't have to worry about it.
So, that's the first reason.
That's the first reason I think
women should be allowed to kill babies.
'Cause life is not so important.
The second reason
is because that's their job.

Page 6/37

Women have to decide who lives and dies.
That's because they're the female
of the species.
In the reproductive arena,
that's what the female does.
They are the selectors.
They have to decide this.
We give them this responsibility
when we fuck them.
We go, "Here, you decide
what to do with this shit."
See you later.
She has to figure out
if you should have kids,
if she should have them. That's her job.
Because women have judgment.
They have judgment.
Men don't have judgment.
Men have intent.
Men just want to spray the world
with their cum, just mist.
"More of me.
More of me."
It's her job to go,
"That's enough of you, I think.
No, that's really enough."
I don't think that face needs to repeat.
I've seen your father,
and it's not getting better.
She doesn't realize this
until after you fuck her.
That's actually when she really knows,
is when you're like, "Yeah!"
And she's like, "I'm not having
this piece of shit's baby."
And that's why abortion is the last line
of defense
against shitty people in the species.
So, we need them
to abort every shitty baby.
I mean, all animals do this.
Animals do it late.
They have the baby.
Then they're like, "You know what?

Page 7/37

It's cold. I'm gonna eat this one."
"But when is it okay?
When should they be allowed?"
When it's in their pussy.
That whole time.
It's in her pussy.
If there's a dude in your pussy,
you get to kill him.
I think that's pretty fundamental.
You're allowed to kill people
if they're in your house.
So... that's what I think.
I have two kids.
I try to be a better person
around my kids.
I try to change my behavior around them.
Like, I have rules in my house,
they all apply to me.
Like, I have a rule
that I don't curse around my kids.
That's a rule. It does happen.
You have a stressful moment,
and you're with your kids,
so, you say something by mistake.
One time I was making dinner for my kids,
and I gave my daughter a bowl of soup.
And I said, "Here's your fucking soup."
But, uh...
You can see
how that was a tough... situation.
You're supposed to teach your kids right
from wrong. I don't know, it's confusing.
Some people raise their kids religiously
and that covers it.
They kind of go, all this. Do that.
I'm not raising my kids religiously
because I don't feel like it.
Get up on a Sunday? Fuck that.
Fuck that.
Let your souls rot, kids. I don't care.
I'm not getting...
"Daddy, who's Jesus?"
"None of your business. Go back to bed."
But my kids, they're living in the world.

Page 8/37

There's a lot of religion in the world.
You have to teach your kids.
If you're not raising them religiously,
you teach them about religion.
I tell my kids the same thing.
I tell them that there are many religions
in the world, and they're all equal.
But the Christians are the main one.
That's what I tell them.
The Christians won.
They're the winners.
So, act accordingly.
Congratulate Christians
when you meet them.
Because they won the world.
And it's true. It's true.
We love to tell ourselves, like,
"Every religion is exactly..."
No. No, they're not.
The Christians won everything.
A long time ago.
If you don't believe me, let me ask you
a question. What year is it?
I mean, come on.
What year is it according
to the entire human race?
And why?
What year is it? Anybody?
Sir, just yell out the year.
Thank you. 20... 2016?
No, it's 20... That's right.
It's 2017. What is that?
That's a number.
It's not just any number.
It must be a very important number.
'Cause we're counting to it
in unison as a species.
For thousands of years, we've been going:
"One, two, three...
Come on, everybody, four... "
Now, come on, Africa, five, six..."
What is this number?
We're counting the days since what?
Since there was ever people?

Page 9/37

Or since the sun did something?
Not at all.
It's been 2017 years since what?
Anybody, yell it out.
Christ!
Yes. Christ!
Christ!
That's right.
It's been 2017 years since Christ!
Jesus.
We are counting the days since Jesus.
Together.
Which makes sense if you're Christian.
But what the fuck
are the rest of us doing?
"Jesus was here. Jesus was here.
Jesus was here."
Everybody. Scientists, historians.
"Jesus.
Jesus."
"Jesus plus two, Jesus plus three,
Jesus plus four."
Jesus plus 2017 years,
four months and three days
is when your license expires.
How is that not a win for the Christians?
How is that not a complete win?
That's not a Monday off in October.
That's, "There was no time before Jesus."
And the whole world went, "Okay.
Sure."
Then somebody was like,
"What about the years before him?
There were billions. I mean, infinity."
"Those go backwards."
"You want us to measure most
of history backwards?
To accommodate one religion?"
Uh-huh.
"All right, we'll do it, it's fine.
We'll do it."
The whole world. You ever watch
New Year's Eve around the world?
They always show you how every country

Page 10/37

celebrates. It's kind of cool.
The first is one little island.
It's the first place that's actually
the place that it's the year.
It's a little island in the Pacific.
I forget.
They do a little ceremony
for New Year's Eve every year.
And they just wear grass.
'Cause they don't even have sticks yet.
They're in the grass age.
They have no clocks.
But they do a dance.
"2017."
And it goes around the world,
"Oh, the 2017."
"Death to all Christians in 2017."
The Jews are quietly keeping track.
It's really 5,766.
But that's for us. We're just...
That's okay.
We're keeping track for when you
snap out of it. It's all right. I'll...
I'll write yours on my check.
I don't want a problem.
What about Chinese New Year?
Yeah, what about Chinese New Year?
All right,
next time you're doing your taxes,
just write "monkey" where the year goes.
Just put monkey.
See what happens to your funds.
No. It's 2017, year of our Lord...
Jesus o'clock on the nose.
And they made it up,
that's the weirdest part.
They got to rename years
that had already taken place.
'Cause, you know,
that's not what those years were.
You know that, right?
That the year three...
wasn't the year three...
during the year three.

Page 11/37

Nobody was walking around back then,
"Hey, what year is it?" "It's three."
"Yeah, but I'm 28.
How can I be 28...
if there's only been three?"
"Oh, well, see, you were born in BC 24.
And there's a zero.
Remember it went backwards?
Oh, shit. That was stressful.
I hated those years."
What was that like?
"What year is it?" "Ten."
"What year is it now?" "Nine."
What the fuck is gonna happen?!
So, I don't know what to tell my kids.
My kids, they wanted a dog.
So, I got them a dog.
I got them a dog, which was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gotten the dog.
Because we rescued a dog.
- We got a... we adopt...
- Whoo!
Yes, you must re... yes, always rescue.
If you get a dog, get a rescue dog.
Don't get a puppy...
from those horrible people
who professionally raise dogs carefully.
No.
You need to just get a mystery dog...
that's been beaten and abused
and traumatized
on the streets of Puerto Rico.
And can't talk about it to anyone now.
They never know.
"Do you know anything about the dog?"
"Uh, she's afraid of pennies.
So, we think maybe somebody's been
throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.
But, otherwise, no."
So, you take this random dog
and just put it in your house
with your family,
and watch their personality unfold.
This dog is insane.

Page 12/37

I'll walk into the kitchen, and the dog
is just standing there alone like this...
I'm like, "You all right?
Are you all right?"
My kids are terrified of the dog.
My daughter goes to pet the dog,
dog goes like...
She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't
think you should ever pet our dog, honey."
I took her to the vet.
I took the dog to ask her what to do.
The vet said,
"Listen, I think there's something
you should seriously consider."
I was like,
"Please be saying to kill this dog.
Please be a doctor
that says the dog dies now."
But she didn't. She said...
She said, "I think you should consider
Prozac... for the dog."
I was like, "Really?"
She said, "Yeah, it works.
It calms the dog right down.
But it's a big decision,
and you should think about it."
I said,
"Put four in her asshole right now.
What do I have to think about?
I don't give a shit
what she's experiencing.
Fucking fix it.
Give her heroin. Shoot her up."
"Come on, puppy."
"Wow, your dog is really chill."
"Yeah.
It only costs $400 a day
to keep her like that."
I didn't always feel this way.
I used to love animals.
I used to worry about animals.
Just animals.
When I was like 20,
"Are all the doggies okay everywhere?

Page 13/37

I certainly hope so."
But I'm 49, and I got two kids now.
You know what happens?
Your circle of concern tightens.
I have four nephews.
I don't love any of them.
Fuck a dog.
You know those ads, like the PSA
on television about abused animals?
They show you a dog with, like,
an empty socket, and he's like...
And they're always wet.
I feel like they hose them down
before they film them.
And the voice comes on,
"Look at these dogs.
These dogs are beaten every day.
Please send us money
so that this can stop."
Are you beating up the dogs?
How's my money fixing that?
You see that PSA
where they show you a sad man?
He's very upset, a very sad man.
He's holding a little sign,
and it says, "Yeah, sure."
And he says, "This is the text
that killed my daughter."
'Cause somebody texted, "Yeah, sure,"
and ran over his kid, which is awful.
Although maybe they were responding
to a text
that said,
"Can you please kill that kid?"
And so, they just...
wrote back and did it.
I'm not saying that makes it better.
I'm just saying
we don't have all the information.
My kids and I were having breakfast
the other day,
and we're listening to NPR.
We always listen to NPR,
because we're better than you.

Page 14/37

And...
We're listening to NPR
at breakfast the other morning.
There was this story
where they kept using this phrase.
They kept saying, "9/11 deniers."
They kept saying that.
"9/11 deniers."
And my daughter was like, "What is that?"
I said, "Well, it's a group of people that
think September 11th was a conspiracy."
And she said, "Oh, I thought
they were saying nine 11-deniers."
Yeah, she thought they meant nine people
who just ain't buying this 11 bullshit.
Just a small fringe group, really.
There's only nine of them.
But they still got on NPR.
They got on the radio
because... they're dedicated.
They protest every day.
They're the nine 11-deniers.
They're outside of the White House,
"It goes, 10, 12, 13!
Me and my eight friends know it!
We are the nine 11-deniers.
We know that 11 is a bullshit number...
propagated on the people by the man.
Why do we have 11?
When we have 13,
and 14 and 15...
and 16, 17,
motherfucking 18, and 19,
but we do not have a one-teen.
What happened to one-teen?
The government took one-teen,
and replaced it
with some bullshit called 11.
We are the nine that deny that shit.
Mr. President, give us back one-teen!"
I don't mean to offend
any Chinese people with this stereotype.
But...
"That's right, I'm Chinese, motherfuckers.

Page 15/37

I'm from Beijing.
I lived in Shanghai.
I'm Chinese-er than a motherfucker.
Chopsticks and whatnot."
Ha! All right.
I'm sorry.
Here's the thing...
stereotypes are harmful.
That's the truth.
But the voices are funny.
And I don't know how
to reconcile those two facts.
I enjoy doing the voices.
But they're offensive.
So, I do them at home.
I used to do them for my kids.
They liked them,
didn't know it was a race thing.
They enjoyed it. "Do the friendly man."
"You want me
to be the friendly man, little girl?"
"We love the friendly man."
"He loves little white girls.
Let's have some scrambled eggs."
They grew up, and I was like,
"Don't talk about the friendly man
at school.
Maybe don't talk to your teachers
about that."
My kids go to public school
in New York City.
Yeah, all right.
Send your kids there then.
Yeah, it's good. It's good.
To teach them
that that's what life is like.
The teachers amaze me because...
I don't know, the worst...
Here's the worst thing about this country,
is that there's no more noble profession
than to be a public school teacher.
Please. Please, don't.
You're not gonna like it.
You're not gonna like where it's going.

Page 16/37

I don't recommend clapping at any things.
You'll regret it at the end of the thing.
In a democracy, there's no more
noble contribution you can make
than to teach in a public school.
In this country, the people that do that,
they're fucking losers.
They're just rock-bottom fucking losers!
And everybody knows it,
but they keep doing it.
New people are teaching every day,
knowing how shitty it is.
They show up, tell them ahead of time.
"Hi, what is this job?"
And they say,
"Okay, here's what we need you to do.
We need you to make children know math."
Wow.
"Do they wanna know math?"
"No, they don't want to know it.
You need to make them know it
against their will.
While they're exploding sexually
and beating the shit out of each other."
"Who are these children?"
"Just whatever kids live
near the building."
Heh. "How much do I get paid?"
"About $10 every four years."
"What if I get good at it? What happens?"
"Nothing. Nothing happens.
Nobody notices, and you get fired,
and you die alone."
"Okay, I'll try it for 25 years."
My daughter is learning
about Greek mythology.
And she's asking me questions about it.
She's like,
"Daddy, who's Achilles' mother?"
I said, "I don't fucking know.
Don't ask me that shit.
I don't know who Achilles' mother."
Don't yell out if you know.
"It's Campampetes."

Page 17/37

Nobody cares what you know.
She had a question about Achilles,
it was interesting.
I'll tell it to you. But first,
the story of Achilles real quick.
Achilles was a baby.
He was a Greek baby.
And... he didn't stay that way.
But when he was... a Greek baby,
his mother, who was a goddess,
took him to the River Styx,
which is at Hades, the land of the dead.
And she dipped him in the water
of the River Styx
because there was a magical quality
to that water
that you would make you impervious
of any harm.
You couldn't be hurt.
It was like a shield, right?
So, she dipped him in that water
to protect him.
But she held him by the heel.
That's the important detail.
Held him by the heel,
which is an awkward way to hold a baby.
By the heel.
Try holding a baby by the heel
and dipping it in a river.
You will never see that baby again.
That's how to get rid of a baby.
"I lost the baby in the water.
I was trying to wash him,
and he fell in the river.
I'm sorry, Miss Achilles,
I lost your baby.
You told me to hold him by the heel.
He slipped."
Because Achilles' mother
has a Mexican nanny.
It's a lesser-known character
in The Iliad.
Anyway...
his mother, she was able to hold on,

Page 18/37

of course, because she was a goddess.
She was the goddess of grip or whatever,
I don't know.
And she held on.
And then he was protected,
except on his heel.
His heel was not protected.
And so that's what we call
your Achilles heel,
your one vulnerable place.
Everybody's got their Achilles heel.
Achilles' Achilles heel was his heel.
Like, literally.
Anyway, so, my daughter,
here was her question.
She said, "How come his mother
didn't just dip him again?
She could have just dipped him
one more time...
with the other leg in there."
What does she just, like, get...
You're right there.
Was there, like, a sign that says,
"One dip per goddess"?
You ever color an Easter egg?
It's not that complicated.
You dip it, and then you hold
it differently and dip it again.
Smart kid. I was proud of her.
But at the same time, I thought, "Who
the fuck are you to judge this woman?"
It bothered me.
'Cause here's what the story
of Achilles teaches me,
is that, if you're a parent,
it's never enough what you do
for these motherfuckers.
It's just never enough.
It's still gonna be your fault.
How much more do you want from a mother?
She dipped her kid in magic water
and protected 99% of his body.
Is any of it up to him?
He could have just wore a big shoe

Page 19/37

and be careful.
But he goes out in sandals,
fucking flip flops.
And a sword, and fights the whole planet.
"I'm Achilles 'cause my mother dipped me."
Finally, somebody got him in the heel,
and he's like, "Mom!
Thanks a lot, Mom."
"What's wrong, Achilles?"
"My mom didn't dip my heel.
She's so stupid. She ruined it."
Fuck you, Achilles, you Greek dick.
I hate the way people talk
about their mothers.
I was watching a football game,
and this guy scored a bunch of shit,
whatever, and they were excited.
So, they asked him about it afterwards.
And the football player said,
"My mom died last year,
but I know she was watching my game
from heaven tonight."
And I wanted to be there to say,
"Leave your mother alone.
How dare you.
She's dead."
I mean, when are you done
with your fucking kids?
When are you finished
with your fucking kids?
Even after you're dead, you still have
to go to their fucking games and shit?
Leave your mother alone.
She did her job.
She raised you, and it killed her.
Let her enjoy heaven. Don't you want
your mother to enjoy heaven?
Isn't that what you want?
Your mom to be just in heaven.
Whee! This poor woman. Angels were like,
"We're having a party.
You want to come with us?"
"I can't. I got to watch my son's game.
He'll be very upset.

Page 20/37

Okay, go... He can't fucking hear me.
Why am I doing this?"
I just think when people die,
it means they did their jobs.
And you should forget them.
That's what I think.
'Cause it's unfair what we put
on dead people.
"Are you watching over me?"
"Yes, I'm watching all of it."
You know like an old...
When you see an old couple,
they've been married for, like, 60 years?
You know that story?
Everybody loves that.
The people that always get applause based
on the math of their lives.
"How long you been married?"
"Sixty years."
Aw.
Aw.
Isn't that automatically wonderful?
How do you know?
You just know how long it's been.
For 60 years, every morning,
he tells me I'm a piece of shit.
Let's just say
this is a happy couple, okay?
They love each other.
They've been married for 60 years.
That's longer
than most people wanna be alive.
And they've been together that long.
And now they're just an old couple.
And they just walk together.
You know when you see two people...
They don't need anybody else,
just the two of them.
This is both of them. They just walk.
They always walk somewhere,
nobody walks there. There's trash.
There's trucks.
He's wearing a suit that is not a color.
She's wearing a dress that's like

Page 21/37

a triangle, like a kid drew it.
It's just, fucking,
a dress with fruit on it.
Nobody cares.
And they just walk every day.
It's cold.
Yeah, it's cold.
You want to go to the store
and get a cracker?
Yeah, let's get a cracker
at the store.
Yeah.
And then one day, usually he dies first.
They're walking, and he goes...
And she says, "Richard!"
"Richard!"
And he dies.
So, now it's just her.
Just Rose.
And she's alone.
And now she just stands in their house.
Somebody goes to get Rose
'cause there's a wedding.
"Come on, Rose. Nadine's getting married.
Nadine...
It doesn't matter, just fucking come on.
Come on. Fucking come on.
Fuck!"
Just want to push her from beh...
She lives ten more years.
Ten years after Richard dies.
And then ten years later,
now she's laying in a bed.
She's dying.
Somebody's there with her, on their phone.
So, Rose is dying, and she says:
"Well, at least now
I get to be with my Richard... forever."
Where did she get that idea?
Where did that come from?
I've looked it up.
No religion teaches
that when you die, you get to ruin heaven
for your dead spouse.

Page 22/37

Why is that fair?
Who gets...
Richard's been dead for ten years.
He's been in heaven for ten years.
And somebody comes up to him,
"Hey, your wife is coming."
"What?
Excuse me. What did you just walk up
and say to me just now?"
"Yeah, Rose just died.
She'll be here in about 20 minutes.
They've just got to hose her down
and tape the wings on.
And then you're gonna be together
forever."
"Wait a minute. Fuck.
You said this was heaven. Why is this...
I have a girlfriend here now.
I don't wanna fucking... "
"She's the love of your life." "She's not
the love of my death, motherfucker."
That's marriage. Marriage is a big deal.
Marriage is a big deal.
I went to a wedding the other day.
I went to a gay wedding.
I've been to a lot of gay weddings,
which is not true.
It's not true at all.
But... I did go to one.
But I don't go to weddings, generally,
because I don't like them. I hate it.
Don't invite me. Really. I think it's rude
to invite people to your wedding. I do.
Nobody's happy to get that shit.
You make it all pretty.
And they're like, "Aw, fuck!
This is gonna suck!"
"Here's a helpful list of places
to stay... "
"Oh, great.
I get to live in a La Quinta...
in Reading, Pennsylvania
for three days...
because you want to get married

Page 23/37

for a couple of years."
Nobody wants to watch you
start your shitty thing.
Nobody wants to see it.
Everybody's in a shitty thing.
That's what it is to be with somebody.
You're either alone,
or you're in a shitty thing.
That covers 100% of human beings.
I can see there's young couples here.
You're like, "No, we're in a good one...
It's really good."
"Yeah, fuck you.
Who do you think you are?
It just didn't get shitty yet.
So arrogant."
"Yeah, I think we figured it out."
"No... Yeah, you're the first ones."
Of course it's going to get shitty.
That's part of it.
It's like going to a horror movie,
and in the first minute, you're like,
"I think they're all gonna be fine."
No, they're all gonna die.
And you're gonna hate the person
you love right now.
That's the way it works.
Love plus time minus distance equals hate.
That's just the way it goes.
I'm not saying don't do it.
You should do it.
It's the best thing.
It's the best part of life, love is.
But don't be greedy and expect it to last.
Don't be amazed that a butterfly died
'cause you shot it in the face.
Just fall in love, make a fucking mess.
It goes shitty,
you don't realize it until too late.
And then you cry a lot and move on.
It's the best part of life.
It is. I've always loved love.
It's always been my favorite part of life
is meeting somebody and going, "Oh, shit!

Page 24/37

That person!" That's the best feeling.
Now, why the fuck would that just,
"Oh, yeah!
For years, for our whole lives,
just, aw, yeah!"
That's insane to expect that.
It's a little thing you get to catch.
And then it rots and dies.
That's just the way it goes.
It's like if you see a person in the park
making bubbles with a big wand with soap.
And sometimes they make a really big one,
and everybody goes, "Oh, yeah!
Shit. Okay, that's all."
You don't stand over it, "Liar!"
You don't get mad at the soap stain.
It gets so shitty, man.
It does.
Whoo!
All the little intricate parts.
Like, I was in an e-mail fight recently.
You ever been in an e-mail fight?
Some of you are in an e-mail fight
right now.
You know, an e-mail fight.
Not a text fight.
A text fight is like, "Fuck you." Boop!
"Yeah, fuck you." Byew.
"Dick." Boop!
"Asshole." Byew.
That's a text fight.
An e-mail fight is like, "In June
when I told you that I had this issue,
I was very disappointed
in the way you didn't listen."
You know, those e-mails,
you just work on it all night.
Like it's the closing argument
to a murder case.
It's so important, your fucking e-mail.
You're pounding it out like Beethoven,
and you're pouring water on your head,
and going deaf and still working on it.
And then you send it somebody.

Page 25/37

"Can you read this
and tell me if it's fair what I wrote?
Start at the bottom."
And they write back,
"I made a few changes."
"Oh, thank you.
That really captures my voice. And yet..."
You send it to somebody else,
they're like:
"I would take out 'Eat shit, fuck face, '
because it clouds your better points."
And you're like,
"Fuck you, I'm going to keep it."
And then finally, you send it.
And you're like, "Hmm."
And then you feel really good.
"I finally said it. Finally."
And you have this fantasy that they're
at home reading it right now going...
I'm wrong about all of the things.
During the day,
they haven't written back yet,
and you know
it's 'cause you just bewitched them.
And you decide,
"I'm going to read my e-mail.
I'm going to read the e-mail
that I wrote."
Is there any more disgusting
modern human behavior
than reading
your own already sent e-mails?
Is there any more scratching your asshole
and smelling your finger than that?
I do it all the time.
So, that's what I did.
I was in an e-mail fight.
And...
And I looked in the sent folder,
where it's all...
That's it. It's in stone.
You can't change that anymore.
I realized I left something there

Page 26/37

by mistake.
I left something at the top of the e-mail
by mistake.
And it said, "This is my latest draft.
What do you think?"
So, now the rest of it is just shit.
It's shit now!
'Cause she knows
I have a writing staff and a focus group.
There should be credits
at the end of this fucking e-mail.
Approved by mother and sister.
I don't know.
Love is worth it, though. It really is.
It's worth it. It is.
I mean, I've always been...
I've always pursued love my whole life.
Even when I was a kid, I loved girls.
I loved them.
And there was all...
When I was 12, I discovered
that girls are the greatest thing.
I would ask them out. That's what I did.
I walked up and asked them out.
I had no fear.
I'd go up to any girl I liked,
"You want to go out with me?"
And she was like, "No!"
You weren't supposed to do that.
You weren't supposed to ask her out.
There was a system.
My daughters told me
it still works this way in school.
There's a thing
where the boy asks his friend
to ask her friend to ask her
what she would say...
if he asked her out.
How do children just know this...
Elizabethan parlor thing?
Twelve-year-old boy.
"Please inquire after her maiden friend.
Were I to request her presence...
what might be her answer?"

Page 27/37

"Indeed, my lady would enjoy...
your company, sir,
were you to make your desires known."
"That is well.
May I finger her?"
"You are bold, sir.
And finger her, you may."
"And finger her, I shall."
Anyway,
I didn't do any of that myself.
I just would just ask them out.
They always said no. Girls said no to me.
Until Rachel.
Rachel was the first girl who said yes.
I asked her to the dance
in eighth grade, and she said yes.
Happiest moment of my life, even to now.
I never beat it.
Anyway, Rachel said,
"Yes, I'll go to the dance with you."
So, we went to the dance.
I was 13.
It was my first time with a girl.
About five minutes into the dance,
she comes to me and she says,
"Do you mind if I dance with Jeff?"
I was like, "Okay."
'Cause what other moves did I have...
at 13?
What else are you gonna say?
"Do you mind if I dance with Jeff?"
"Yeah, I do. I mind very much.
What the fuck do you think this is,
Rachel?
You know what? Get your shit.
We're leaving right now.
Shut the fuck up, Rachel.
I swear to God."
I didn't have any of those tools.
So, I said, "Okay,"
and she danced with Jeff.
And made out with Jeff and left with Jeff.
That was it.
And I learned...

Page 28/37

That guy Jeff... this is a true story.
That guy Jeff, he's a woman now.
That's what happened.
It's true.
I was looking up on Facebook people
from my past, and he's a woman.
And she has a whole blog on Facebook
about becoming a woman.
I was up all night reading it.
I was crying. It was amazing.
I was like, "This is incredible."
And then at the end,
there's a picture of her with hair.
And she says, "I didn't change.
I knew what I was all along.
I knew I was a girl
since I was 6 years old."
And I read that, and I thought,
"Why did you take my fucking date then?
You knew? You piece of shit!
Fuck you, Jeff!
Fuck you and your journey.
I don't give a shit now.
Hooray for transgender, but fuck you,
because you're just an asshole.
Who became a cunt. That's what happened."
I envy transgender people, though. I do.
It's a tough road,
but I envy them on this level
that they figured out what's going on
with them, and they fixed it.
What an amazing gift,
to know what the fuck is wrong with you.
Who else gets to have that?
It's just a mushy,
I don't fucking have any idea!
I would give a million dollars
to just wake up,
"Oh, I'm an owl.
That's what the thing is.
I've just got to blink slow
and eat a mouse."
'Cause life is very confusing.
Even I'm 49 years old, and I haven't found

Page 29/37

a cruising altitude to my identity.
I'm still fucking confused.
I get new feelings, and they upset me.
I don't like new feelings.
I want to know what I like and get it
and just die.
That's what I want to do at this point.
Like I have a weird relationship
with this movie that's on cable sometimes.
It's called Magic Mike.
You ever seen this movie? Magic Mike.
For those of you who are watching this
on video many years from now,
Magic Mike was a movie
about male strippers
starring Matthew McConaughey
and Channing Tatum.
Whoo!
It was a very different country
when it was made
from whenever you're watching.
But anyway...
We had a whole other thing going on.
This building's not here anymore.
But...
You're watching it on a dusty thing,
and it's all rubble.
And you're watching this.
I don't know why you're watching this
out of everything.
But when things were real easy,
we made movies like Magic Mike.
It's just a nice movie
about men who strip.
And every time I'm flipping around
and it comes on, I always stop.
And then I play a little game of chicken
with this movie.
I stop because it's a good movie.
It's well made,
directed by Steven Soderbergh,
good director.
And so I get into it, I get into
the story, and then they start stripping.

Page 30/37

And then I start having
all these feelings.
My face gets a little hot.
At first, I just get hostile
for no reason.
I just... fucking... fucking...
But then there's one part of the movie
that I like.
I have a favorite part... of Magic Mike,
so, I always stick around for that part.
It's the part where Matthew McConaughey,
he's wearing leather pants, no shirt.
And he goes,
"The law says you cannot touch.
But I think I see a lot
of lawbreakers out there."
Like, just that...
It's, like, perfect.
Just the way it rolls out of him.
"I think I see a lot
of lawbreakers out there."
I just really like that.
I like it.
When the movie comes on, I'm always like,
"Let's get to where he says that."
And then he says it, and I'm like,
"Fucking good, that's really good."
I like it a lot.
Here's how much I like it.
I don't do impressions,
and I kind of nail that one
because I think about it all the time.
I'm walking around my house, like,
"The law says you can't touch.
The law says you can't touch."
Then I go up to my dog,
"But I think
I see a lot of lawbreakers right here."
I like that part.
After he says it,
all these strippers come in.
Matthew McConaughey
and all these strippers.
Channing Tatum comes out, fucking...

Page 31/37

And then I go, like, "Fuck!"
And then I have to stop.
I'm starting to get a feeling.
I'm starting to get, like, a feeling.
It's not a boner.
It's not a boner.
But I can feel my dick starting
to turn over a little bit.
Just starting to...
You know when you can feel
your dick kind of unfold?
It's like a pool toy
that's been blowing up for a while.
The wrinkles are starting
to come out. It's taking shape.
Just that early...
My dick's just waking up.
What are you guys doing here?
I've never watched the whole movie.
I've never seen Magic Mike
in its entirety.
Because I don't wanna see it.
I don't wanna see the end of Magic Mike.
I know what the end of Magic Mike is.
I'm pretty sure that the end of Magic Mike
is that I'm gay.
I'm pretty sure that's how it ends.
I don't want to see the ending.
I want to stay like this.
You know why? 'Cause I'm 49 years old.
I don't want to enter
the gay community now.
This is not the version of me
that's gonna have an awesome time
as the new gay guy.
So, fuck that.
And that's my right, by the way.
Because that's about me.
That is my life.
I'd never discriminate
against another person for being gay.
I wouldn't dream of it.
But I have every right to oppress
and discriminate against

Page 32/37

my own possible budding homosexuality.
That's mine to just violently push down.
Like it's a dude
I'm trying to make blow me right now.
And you know, I haven't become, like,
generally attracted to men.
I'm not sexually attracted to men.
Just Matthew McConaughey
and Channing Tatum.
Those two guys? Fuck.
Fuck, seriously.
Matthew, with his, like, leathery skin.
He's like, "Hey..."
Just...
Fucking sexy.
And Channing, kind of dumb face, like...
Like, oh, shit!
Fuck. I like it.
But men, in general, I'm not into it.
You know what I think it is?
I'm only gay for the best.
I'm top-shelf gay.
I'm not retail gay, you know what I mean?
I'm not off-the-rack gay.
I'm not gonna go to JC Penney's
and suck a bunch of dicks.
I'm going to go to Neiman Marcus
and get the signature collection.
Platinum dick.
The best.
The best dick.
'Cause I'll try the best anything.
If it's the best one, I'll try it.
Like, I don't like cognac.
I would never buy a bottle of Hennessy
and keep it in my house.
But I've never tried the best cognac.
If somebody was like,
"Would you like to try this cognac? It's...
This cognac was 500 years old
300 years ago."
Like, "Yeah. Fucking give me that."
If somebody asked me
to go to a Kenyan restaurant,

Page 33/37

I don't want to go to a Kenyan restaurant.
I know all the foods that I like.
If somebody was like,
"This is the best Kenyan restaurant.
It takes six months to get a reservation.
I can get you in.
They fly live turtles in.
And you eat it, you bite off
its screaming face while it's alive.
And every turtle you eat is the last
of his species."
I can't wait to eat that fucking turtle.
I'm going to end his people with my mouth.
The best, I'll try it.
If somebody was like,
"We have a guy here, he has the best dick.
The best dick ever.
His dick has been soaking in olive oil
since he was five years old.
We've been feeding him nothing
but butter and penises his whole life.
He has the best dick,
and you can suck it right now."
"Well, let me see it.
Can I see it?
Can you take it out?
Oh, shit. That's beautiful. Oh, my God.
That's my favorite thing now.
Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.
Bring it closer. I don't know what I'm
gonna do, but bring it closer, please."
I think, at that point,
you put it in your mouth, right?
If you're looking at the best dick ever,
and you're not sure... you wanna suck it,
just put it in your mouth.
And then decide.
Just for like 20 seconds.
Whoo!
That's a long time.
That's 20 seconds.
That's a long time
to have a dick in your mouth...
that you're ambivalent about.

Page 34/37

It's 20 sec...
If you have a dick in your mouth
for 20 seconds, you are not deciding.
Twenty seconds.
This is... I'll show you. This is
20 seconds with a dick in your mouth.
No.
No.
Yeah, I decided not to suck that dick...
that's been in my mouth all day.
I don't like dicks.
That's why I'm not gay.
That really is the reason. I hate dicks.
Penises are very disgusting to me.
To me. I don't want to yuck your yum.
I just think they're gross.
I always hated penises.
I hated my father's penis. I did.
I did. I hated my father's penis.
When you're a little boy,
you're gonna see your dad's dick.
If you go to a restaurant,
you're probably gonna see your dad's dick.
I should explain that, right?
That sounds like I have a weird father.
"All right, we're going out to eat.
Everybody take a look."
No, sometimes if you go
to a restaurant with your family,
when it's time to pee, you go pee
with your dad if you're a little boy.
If you go to a ballgame with your dad,
there was...
There were never urinals.
It was just a trough.
And the little boys and the men
stand there together.
And the men are just standing there...
And we're down here, the little boys.
And the dicks are eye-level.
Just horrible, pissing dicks.
In both directions,
like a chorus line, just...
And my dad had the worst dick.

Page 35/37

He had the worst.
'Cause my dad...
First of all, my father's Mexican.
It's true. My father is Mexican. I'm not.
I'm not Mexican. My father is.
Just 'cause some Mexican fucked my mom
for years... doesn't make me a Mexican.
It just makes her a whore.
But, anyway... my dad...
My father had a Mexican, Catholic,
uncut, raw, organic...
local, fucking free-range Mexican dick.
It was just so basic.
It was like a farmer's market yam,
just sticking out like a tamarindo pod.
And the pee would spray out of it.
I'm like, "Dad, open your dick
before you pee out of it."
It's like you're pissing out
of the corner of a pillowcase.
And my dad's life is...
My dad's had a weird life.
Too.
When I was ten years old, my parents got
divorced, and my dad turned into a Jew.
I mean, he converted...
to Judaism. He didn't turn into a Jew.
It's not like my dad was like...
He...
converted... to Judaism.
And I had friends who were Jewish.
And I knew that they had little
clipped dicks, little... little neat...
And then I remembered
my father's alligator claw of a penis.
I really hate penises.
That's really my problem with being gay.
That's why I'm not gay. Men are fine.
I'd like to have a boyfriend,
that would be nice.
I would. Every time I hear somebody say
"my boyfriend,"
I'm always like, "I want a boyfriend."
Why can't I have a boyfriend?

Page 36/37

I'd like to have a big, tall boyfriend.
That's my boyfriend.
I'm mad at my boyfriend.
I get to wear his jacket.
It's all big on me.
I'm like, "This is my boyfriend's jacket.
I feel safe."
I know I would like it.
I would like to have a big dude
in my life.
Comes up behind me like this.
I'm like, "Hi."
Like, I know that would be nice.
But in order to get all those parts,
you have to have a fucking cock
shoved up your asshole.
Like a hard dick ramming in your...
Ow!
"Oh, fuck.
Oh.
I just wanted to wear your jacket."
Thanks a lot, you guys. You were great.
Thank you very, very much.
In the days of my youth
I was told what it means to be a man
Now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things
The best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam
Good times, bad times
You know I've had my share
When my woman left home
For a brown-eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to...


–


One of my hobbies 
is I collect dust. 
Are you from this country? 
I go around town 
slashing tire prices. 
Do you get that? 
Do you know that Christmas song "Do You Hear What I Hear?" 
Do you? 
You stopped laughing. 
You stopped laughing, sir. 
You got the idea, 
there are no jokes. 
There's a kind of hush 
all over this room. 
I'm addicted to 
prescription glasses. 
And "20/20" wants to do 
my life story. 
It gets wor 
A four-year-old wrote this. 
Thank you. 
No, I'm not leaving yet, 
hold on. 
This is my stepladder. 
I never knew my real ladder. 
I heard great things 
about my real ladder, 
that he supported three people at one time. 
Last I heard, he's one 
I fucked that up, too. 
The last I heard, he was in 
a 12-step program. 
It really didn't matter. 
Oh, thank you. 
Anyway, I've had a lovely 
That's it for me, thank you very much, thank you very much. 
Anyway, with that, 
I'm gonna bring up the man. 
Do you know the man? 
Mister who? 
Page 2/48
Mr. Louie-who, what? 
Mr. Louis Prima? No. 
Mr. Louis Armstrong? No. 
Mr. Louis C.K.! 
Here he is. 
Thank you. 
Oh. 
Oh, my God, you guys. 
Oh, my God, thank you. 
This 
You guys... 
You guys are great, thank you. This is what I talk like now, 
just so you know. 
I'm gonna do 
the whole show like this. 
A really-a very offensive 
stereotype... 
...of a Mexican. 
This is... 
This is a Mexican at the border. Just let me in! 
Jesus! 
He won't let me 
You guys are dicks 
in there, anyways! 
Fuck you, America! 
Was that too high up, 
do you think? 
That's why I like 
I always like to stand 
just a little bit wrong, 
you know? 
Just for my own entertainment, instead of standing like this, just put it a little bit up 
here, just so people are like I don't know why 
that bothers me. 
Especially if I'm somewhere 
I don't like being, like CVS. 
You know, I hate CVS. 
But sometimes 
you gotta go in there. 
Page 3/48

That should be 
their slogan, CVS. 
Sometimes 
you gotta come in here." 
Where else you gonna get 
your wart Band-Aids 
and that stuff 
for your dry vaginer? 
Dry vaginer. 
I used to think 
it was called a "vaginer." 
I did, because I grew up 
in Boston and the 
I don't know 
if you are familiar with 
People call it 
the Boston accent. 
It's not an accent. 
It's a whole city of people 
saying most words wrong. 
It's just a stupidity 
in a massive region. 
Because my teachers, 
they teach you 
to talk like that. 
My teacher-I had a teacher 
named Miss Daugherty, 
but she thought 
her name was Mrs. Darrity. 
She mispronounced her own name. Mrs. Darrity! 
And she'd give us sex-ed 
This was fifth grade. 
We had sex ed with Mrs. Darrity, and she's showing us 
the diagram, she's like, 
"This is a penis. 
"And this is a vaginer. 
"Now, during intercourse, 
the man ejaculates sperm... 
"... up into the vaginer. 
"And then later, 
"a fucking baby... 
"... comes out of the vaginer. Page 4/48

And sometimes it's 'retahded. '" This was the '70s. 
A teacher said "retahded" 
in Boston in the '70s. 
"My daughter's retahded." 
She used to tell us every day. "I have a daughter 
and she's mentally retahded. 
"She's 35 and she lives 
in my house. 
"She better be fucking retahded. I'm gonna stick her back up 
in my vaginer." 
So I thought it was called 
a vaginer 'til I was, like, 25. And I remember thinking 
it was, like 
It's a vaginer, it's a 
Like, a thing 
that vagines, you know? 
Like, you use it to vagine 
I gotta vagine my driveway. 
I don't know. 
I just gotta vagine 
this new table I just made. 
That would make a nice table, 
like, you make a new table 
and then you take the 
the 80-grit paper 
and you sand it, and then 120, and then you go, "All right, 
honey, get up there," 
and she just... 
Like, an old 
Like, one of those 
Danish tables, or like a... 
Ooh. 
Nice old Italian table. 
"This table is-a very smooth 
"because, eh, my wife 
have a very juicy pussy 
"and she vagine the table 
and my family, 
we do this 
Page 5/48
for generations, we vagine." 
All right. 
So I'm 47 now, and, uh... 
Yeah, I know, that's about 
what it's worth. 
That's what it 
That's what that deserves. 
"Woo." 
"Woo." 
"Woo!" 
Yeah, 47 doesn't 
buy you anything. 
18, you can vote, 
21, you can drink, 
and 47, you can just 
Just keep doing whatever. 
Just do... 
Just keep being out of breath. One good thing is that 
I've let go of any dream 
of getting in great shape, 
like, it's like a relief. 
Just 'cause 
My whole life I've been like, 
well, someday, I should 
really get in great shape. 
Now, I'm like, what? 
Why would I do that? 
That's not gonna happen. 
Just 
To me, the bar, 
the level I wanna reach 
as far as the shape I'm in, 
I just want it to be 
so that if you find out 
that I died, 
you ask "What happened?" 
That's all. 
I want you to wonder 
what happened. 
I don't want it to be 
like, "Oh, he died?" 
Oh, yeah, well, sure. 
Sure he did. 
Page 6/48
Sure he did. 
This'd be bigger news to you 
Did you hear 
Louie's still alive? 
Shit. 
Oh, really? 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God, how? 
How? 
Some things change 
when you get older. 
Like, I've reallocated some 
of the noises that I make. 
Like, the noise 
I used to make when I come 
is now the noise I make 
when I pee. 
Oh... oh... 
Oh... 
Ah... 
Ahhh... 
Take it all, bitch. 
Very disrespectful 
to my toilet, unfortunately. 
Yeah, you like that piss, 
don't you? 
Bitch! 
I'm gonna shit in your mouth, 
too, 'cause you ain't nothing 
but a shit-eatin', 
piss-drinkin' toilet! 
Dumb bitch, toilet! 
You ain't intelligent. 
You ain't even been outside. 
You sit there waiting for me 
to shit in your face. 
Got piss on your lips. 
You ain't even special. 
I pissed in three toilets today. You ain't shit. 
That's terrible. 
That's awful. 
But that's how my dad 
treated his toilet, 
Page 7/48
so that's where I learned it. 
It's a shame. 
So that's the noise 
I make when I pee. 
And, uh, some of you 
might be wondering 
None of you are wondering... 
...what noise do I make 
when I come. 
So this is the noise 
I make when I come. 
I just go... 
It is done! 
It's a whole thing with clouds and lightning and crows. 
The circle is complete! 
It's kind of intense. 
And there's a little witch 
with white eyes going, 
"And a child will be born!" 
I don't know. 
One time I was 
having sex with a woman, 
it was our first time 
having sex. 
Also turned out to be 
our last time, but I wasn't 
Didn't know that at the 
Anyway, I was getting 
I was gonna come soon, 
so I felt like talking 
about it, and... 
But I didn't know her very well. So it came out weird, 
I said, "Oh, I'm cooming." 
She's like, "What did you say?" 'Cause I was back there. 
That's why. 
That's why 
she had to go like this. 
"What'd you say? 
What was that back there, chief? What was that?" 
'Cause I'm always back there. 
Page 8/48
That's a-that's a weird thing 
to brag about. 
I'm always behind her. 
Every time. 
So they don't see me crying. 
It's weird having sex 
with a woman from behind 
'cause you don't know 
what's going on the whole time and you get kinda paranoid. 
The whole time, 
she might be like... 
I was on the subway in New York. This isn't another sex story. 
This is a traveling story. 
Are you ready? 
So I'm on the subway 
and I'm standing there 
I wasn't holding anything, 
I just like to stand like this. I'm standing there. 
I walk around the city 
like this. 
Hi. 
So I'm standing there and 
from behind me over here, 
I hear this. I hear... 
And I was like, whew, okay. 
It's a crazy person. 
I mean, it's not a big surprise in New York. 
Then I heard it again. 
I was like, 
all right, I wanna see, 
I wanna see the crazy person. 
I just wanna take a look. 
So I look over and 
it's not what I expected. 
It wasn't a big homeless guy 
with two sets of headphones 
that don't work 
or anything like that. 
It was a... 
A young woman, 
Page 9/48
she looked like she was about 21 and she's standing there, 
she's very, kinda nice 
Properly dressed. 
She was very, like, 
Michigan-y or something. 
Very suburban-y, Michigan-y 
kinda thing. 
And she's standing there 
with her ponytail, 
and then all of a sudden, 
she starts going like this, 
she goes... 
La-la la-la-la la-la!" 
And I realize, oh, 
she's, like, a student, 
like, a singing music student, and she's doing her vocal 
exercises on the subway. 
You know what? 
It wasn't charming or nice. 
It was arrogant and rude, 
'cause she just had 
this look like, it's 
I'm so cool, 'cause I'm studying music in New York City 
and I just do my thing 
right on the subway every day. La-la la-la-la la-la, everybody! La-la la-la-la la-la, 
tired nurse 
who just did a 14-hour shift! 
We live in an interesting time, you know. 
'Cause you can be 
on an airplane, 
you're like one 
of 200 passengers. 
You're on a flight 
30,000 feet in the air, 
and in the middle of the flight if you just decide to do this, you're sitting in your seat 
and you just start going 
Page 10/48
like this, you go... 
Maaah! 
Maaah! Mahh! 
If you do that and 
don't stop doing it, 
they will land the plane. 
You can will a plane 
to the ground 
without a weapon or a threat. 
You don't even 
have to do that much, 
you can just sit there and 
just start going, "Down! 
Down!" 
Seriously, if you were 
on a plane 
and you just didn't 
stop saying "down." 
"Down! 
Down!" 
"Sir, is there a problem?" 
"Down! 
Down!" 
Fighter jets will appear 
I mean, you're going 
to the nearest airport. 
And then I guess 
you're in trouble, but... 
What? They can't put you, 
like, in prison 
because you said 
"down" several times. 
They, like, bother you. 
"Why'd you do it? 
Are you a terrorist? 
Why'd you do it?" 
"I just-I just didn't want 
to be up anymore. 
"I just didn't like it. 
"I mean, I just said the word 
of the-where I wanted to be. 
"You didn't have to do it. 
It was just a suggestion, 
Jesus Christ." 
Page 11/48
I was on a plane once and there was two babies on the plane. 
And other people, 
it wasn't just... 
It wasn't just me 
and two babies. 
That would be weird. 
You get on a plane, 
there's just two babies. 
Come on, we're leaving soon. 
He's the pilot baby. 
I'm the other baby. 
No, that's all right, 
I'm not gonna... 
You babies have a good flight, but I'm gonna find 
another way to get there. 
Yeah, I don't like the way 
this was starting. 
Anyway, I was on a plane 
and there was these two babies and they were crying 
the whole time, 
crying the whole flight, 
and that happens a lot. 
I don't think they knew each 
other, they were just crying. 
I've seen this 
on so many flights, 
I started to wonder, is there 
a reason for this? 
Is there, like, 
an actual reason why babies 
So I looked it up. Turns out, 
there's an actual reason 
why babies cry on airplanes, 
and it's because they're upset that gay people 
are getting married. 
Yeah. 
They're, like, really upset. 
Like, inconsolably upset. 
Honey, it's 
The country's changing. 
Page 12/48
Waah! 
And I don't agree with them. 
I think if people are in love, they should get married. 
But they can't 
They can't accept that. 
'Cause they're just-You know, 
they're just being babies. 
Babies are selfish. 
They are, babies are selfish. 
They just, waah! 
No baby ever goes, "Waah, 
but how you doing, though?" 
I have two daughters and both of them at one time were babies 
and I held them 
and they cried on planes. 
It's happened to me, 
I've had a baby on a plane. 
If you're ever 
This is how selfish people are. When you're on a plane and 
you hear a baby crying, 
you think that's 
happening to you. 
You're like, "Ugh, this is 
gonna ruin my flight! 
It's gonna ruin it!" 
Well, look at the parent, 
'cause that person is holding 
a crying baby on a plane, 
which means they've been 
traveling with a baby all day, which means they have 
a baby, okay? 
So their life isn't even good. They don't like anything. 
Their whole life is, ugh, Jesus! If there's any joy for them, 
it's that this is now 
bothering other people. 
"Yeah, you listen 
to this shit now!" 
Waah! 
Page 13/48
I remember one time, my baby 
was crying on the plane, 
she was really upset, 
and this guy, 
some businessman on the plane, 'cause businessmen 
always think that every flight is a private plane of theirs 
that we're all, like, 
piggybacking on. 
And this guy has 
his fucking newspaper 
and he turns around to look 
at me and my baby 
and he looks right at me. 
He doesn't kinda, like, 
go like this. 
He looks at me like, hmm? 
Like, could you? 
I'm like, "Oh, I'm sorry, 
is this bothering you? 
Let me just..." 
You all just clapped 
for a dead baby. 
You applauded a dead baby. 
I have two children. 
Uh, nine and 12 years old. 
Both girls. 
Uh, they're both gay. 
Um... 
I'm raising 'em gay. 
Most people 
raise their kids straight, 
I'm just gonna raise mine gay. Maybe they'll do what 
they want later, but, uh, 
as long as they're in 
my house, they're gay. 
I tell 'em every day, 
you're gay, honey, good night. Go to bed. 
Brush your gay teeth, gay honey. Don't forget to be gay. 
Having children 
Page 14/48
is a big responsibility 
and I've never really done 
very well at it. 
I've made a lot of mistakes. 
Some of them big, some of them small, you know? 
Like, I'm still a person, 
I still am an idiot, you know, still, like, I 
I got high one night, 
I got really high, because 
I don't do drugs. 
I never do drugs, never. 
So that when I do... 
...they're way more fun. 
To me, that's my best advice 
about drugs. 
If you want to enjoy drugs, 
never do them, never. 
Because then when you do, 
they're actually fun. 
'Cause when drugs 
are a part of your life, 
they're just another pain 
in the ass in your life. 
It's just a, ugh, my drugs suck. I don't want to have 
that problem. 
I always want to be that person where it's a new thing, 
somebody's like, 
hey, you wanna try this? 
And I'm like, oh! 
I don't know if I should. 
This is crazy. 
I don't even know 
how I'm gonna do it. 
I mean, what is this? 
Anyway, I got 
My friend had the little vape I'm a little worried, honestly, by the young people 
with the vaping 
and they just do this 
Page 15/48

and then they just vape. 
And they just stand 
on the corner and puff 
and look at the fucking thing 
and I miss-I miss you. 
That's what it is, 
I miss you people, 
'cause you used 
to stand around like this 
and I get to go, 
"I'd fuck that one, 
and that one's okay," 
but now I don't even 
I'm just looking at the top 
of people's heads now. 
But I didn't realize 
how, like, my friend 
I have a younger friend 
who vapes 
and she told me it's just 
to kinda, like, calm her. 
She's like, I barely feel it, 
you know. 
Sometimes it helps me sleep. 
So one night, we're hanging out and I'm like, I'm gonna go home and go to sleep, 
but I mean, I'll just try it, 
so I took one little tiny hit. I was insane, 
I was completely insane. 
I was in my house, I couldn't 
even walk past a window, 
I had to go under the windows, 'cause I was afraid of 
the inside of my own brain. 
So I started texting people, 
just being 
Just texting, "I'm so high. 
I'm so fucking high. 
I'm so high," and I texted, 
you know, another friend. 
"I'm so high I want to suck 
the pot jizz out of my own dick Page 16/48

and get higher." 
That's what I wrote. 
I'm not bragging, I'm just 
telling you that's what I wrote. And I sent it. 
And then later, I looked 
at my text and I was, like, 
I think I might have sent that to my 12-year-old daughter. 
I think it's possible. 
And I didn't, 
but I too easily could've. 
We need-Now my kids 
are in my phone. 
There needs to be 
some very reliable firewall 
that says, these numbers 
are much harder to text, 
that you can't just, whoops! 
Traumatized her irreversibly! 
That you can go, like, 
to write to these numbers, 
I have to solve the Hellraiser puzzle and I have to... 
There's two guys with the keys in the opposite room 
that turn them 
at the same moment 
and there's a warning. 
"Are you sure you want 
to send this picture 
"of your pubic hair 
to your ex-wife's mother?" 
That's how you want 
to break the silence 
of six years since the divorce. "This is my pubic hair. 
"Look at all of my pubic hair. 
How have you been?" 
I try to be a good dad, 
but, you know, like 
life just kinda takes off 
and kids start, you know, 
they got their own ideas 
Page 17/48
and they're 
My nine-year-old, she's just 
figuring out about lying 
and that's a tough thing. 
It's hard to roll that one back, because lying is pretty 
amazingly useful in life. 
It's like, how do you tell a kid not to use a thing 
that just solves every 
possible problem, like magic? 
How do you... 
'Cause that's why-Kids lie 
'cause they're in trouble. 
They lie 'cause they're in more trouble than they can take, 
you know? 
'Cause kids... 
Nine-year-old, when 
a nine-year-old lies, 
it's not for some weird 
Machiavellian, you know... 
"Do you know what my teacher 
said about you? 
It was interesting." 
They don't just make shit up. 
They lie because 
they're in trouble 
and it's more than they can- 
'Cause trouble 
is too much for a kid. 
Trouble-For grown-ups, 
we can take trouble. 
We don't care. 
We just go, oh, I'm sorry. 
Oh, am I in trouble? 
Oh, whoops! 
We don't care. 
But to a little kid, trouble is like this horrible... 
Did you take the chocolate? 
And she did and she doesn't know how to handle it. 
Did you 
Page 18/48
Did you take it? 
"No." 
Well, all right, then, 
have a nice day. 
How do you then tell her, 
yeah, don't ever apply 
that perfect solution again, 
to terrifying things. 
Mark Twain once said, "A man 
who always tells the truth 
doesn't have to remember 
what he said." 
And that's great. 
But Mark Twain also said, 
"There once was a big black guy named Nigger Jim." 
So... 
I don't know if... 
...a hundred percent 
of the things he said 
were perfectly awesome. 
Really, Mark? Nigger Jim, 
you're gonna go with? 
That's the best you can do, 
to name the 
It's got kind of a nice ring 
to it, Nigger Jim. 
Yeah, well, it's a little 
on the nose, isn't it? 
Could've called him Black Mike, I mean, just a little... 
Take it down one notch of the... Thanks for that, Mark. 
Anyway. 
So, while we're in this area... Now that I know 
you guys are cool. 
No, no. 
No. 
No. Um... 
No, no. 
But, uh-but, uh... 
but... but... 
This is a story 
Page 19/48
that takes place 
I'm gonna tell you this story, it's kind of a messy story. 
It takes place over a lot 
of years, 'cause it start 
It started with my friend Mike, who told me this story. 
This happened to him 
back in the '90s. 
He was going home for Christmas and he lives in Connecticut 
He grew up in Connecticut 
in some shitty shit town 
in shitty, shitty Connecticut, and he didn't like going home. He's one of those people. 
He came from a place 
Doesn't like it anymore. 
And he goes back 
He doesn't know how 
to handle his family, you know, and he came from a family 
of white racists 
and he doesn't like going home, but it's still home, 
so he went home 
for Christmas one year 
and everybody's hanging out 
during the day, talking, 
having lunch, 
and his father and his brother both work at this factory 
and his brother's grousing 
about his day at work 
and he goes, "Yeah, 
and then this fucking nigger 
fell asleep at the forklift." 
And then my friend Mike heard 
that and he went, "Oh, God. 
Why am I part of these people? I hate this." 
And he felt bad. 
And then that night, 
he's in the kitchen 
Page 20/48
and he's having a warm milk 
or whatever and he... 
I don't know why that's 
I don't know 
why that's funny, but... 
What that says about him. 
Yeah, 'cause he's a pussy. 
No. 
He's just sort of having 
some time to himself 
and his cousin comes downstairs, who's staying 
And his cousin, 
he likes his cousin. 
That's the one person 
he always felt connected with, and his cousin's like, 
"What's wrong, man?" 
And he says, "Well, jeez, 
I come home and I hoped 
"that everything would be, 
you know, normal, 
"but then, my brother says, 
uhh, he's at the factory 
and this nigger 
fell asleep at the forklift." 
And his cousin goes, 
"Oh, my God, 
the nigger fell asleep 
at the forklift?" 
So this is the first part 
of the story, okay? 
So Mike tells me that story 
about how he's just not listened to by anybody in his family, 
and then later on, I get 
a job writing on a TV show 
for Cedric the Entertainer. 
Great guy, and he had a show 
and he hired a writing staff, 
half white writers, 
half black writers. 
So at lunchtime, we talk 
about race, it was just a 
Page 21/48
We'd have these provocative, 
interesting conversations, 
trading notes about race, 
the white writers 
and the black writers, 
and I told that story. 
I told the whole thing 
about the guy, 
"Uhh, nigger and the forklift," And then the cousin saying, 
"Uhh, the nigger 
at the forklift!" 
And then one of the writers, 
a black writer, 
he goes, "There's nothing worse "than a nigger falling asleep 
at the forklift, 
making it harder 
for the rest of us." 
Still, nobody is quite hearing what my friend 
was going through. 
And then, about a year later, 
I'm hanging out 
with my friend Dino. 
Dino is Greek. 
He has no dog in the race, 
he doesn't care either way. 
He's Greek. Greeks aren't 
white or black, they're just 
He's just got a big nose 
and he just stands there. 
And I told Dino the whole story, I told him about the guy, 
"Uhh, the forklift," 
and the guy, "Uhh!" 
And then the black writer 
And then Dino says, "How do 
you fall asleep at a forklift?" My oldest daughter is gonna be 13 next year, that's a big deal. That's a big deal. 
That's 
All the parents ahead of you 
Page 22/48
always go, like, yeah. 
Yeah, wait 'til she... 
That's when you... 
I'm not afraid 
of her teenagehood. 
It's gonna be challenging 
and difficult 
and she'll meet 
the challenges, you know. 
I'm always proud of my kid. 
She's a good kid. 
Now, some parents are really 
afraid of their daughters. 
A lot of dads get scared, like, I don't know what to do. 
I have this friend, 
his daughter's 15, 
he's like, "She's gonna 
start having sex! 
"I don't know what to do! 
She's gonna have sex, 
what do I do?" 
I'm like, well, 
you don't do anything. 
You don't have a role 
in that at all. 
You're her father. 
No role. 
Not supportive 
or advisory, nothing. 
"But what if she has a bad 
sexual experience?" 
Oh, she's gonna have 
a number of those. 
Oh, yes, she is. 
Her whole life 
is gonna be just walking 
through a blizzard of bad dicks, just... 
Ow! 
Dicks, just 
Jesus. 
What the fuck? 
That was a big one. 
Page 23/48
Holy fuck, I'm just 
trying to get to work. 
The little one, 
the nine-year-old, 
life's a little simpler. 
Tap dancing, she takes 
tap dancing lessons. 
We started her with tap dancing, because we figure 
by the time she grows up, 
it'll be the 1930s again, 
and, uh, yeah. 
She'll have this thing 
she can do 
that nobody enjoys watching. 
Do you know who the audience is for tap dancing? 
The parents of 
tap dancing students. 
That's all of it. 
'Cause we all have 
to go to the show 
at the end of 
the tap dancing semester, 
and they have a big theater show and all the kids get up there, they all tap dance 
in groups of threes. 
There's about 6,000 kids. 
They do about 20 minutes each. So the show's about 
seven months long, 
and everybody dies at the end. But you go because you want 
to see your kid tap dance, 
'cause that's an amazing thing, 'cause this was a baby, 
she was just a baby. 
She was just like... 
That's it. 
And now she's going like this. It's amazing. 
But you gotta watch 
all those other kids 
Page 24/48

that you don't love at all. 
And you gotta watch people, 
grown-ups do it. 
There's grown-up 
Adult students, 
and they get up there. 
Get off! 
Nobody's here to see you! 
Nobody! 
Your parents are dead, 
you're 52! 
Nobody came from work. 
Nobody came from work. 
I take her every-every 
Thursday to tap dancing 
and we go up to the school and she puts on her tap shoes 
and she goes in the little room. I don't go in there, and she 
tap dances and I wait outside, because it's 40 minutes, it's 
not enough time to go anywhere. So I just sit there and listen to... 
And then she comes out. 
"I don't-I'm tired of this. 
I don't want to go anymore." 
Good, don't. 
I don't want to bring you. 
Quit. Quit. 
I don't care. 
I don't push my kids 
into this shit. 
'Cause you gotta do it, too. 
I don't wanna do it. 
"Daddy, I'm tired of soccer." 
Soccer is out of our lives 
forever, 
with those words 
from thine mouth. 
Soccer is gone. 
I don't care 
Don't go to school, 
I don't want to get up at 7:00. Page 25/48

Don't do any of this shit, 
honey. I don't care. 
I have money, just eat 
the food in the house. 
Stay home and eat. 
You and your sister, 
don't have kids, 
I can cover all of us 
and then we all die. 
That's my goal. 
I want to make enough money 
that we can just lock the door and eat the food. 
That's it. 
"Daddy, what are we 
doing today?" 
Go to the food room and pick 
something out and go to bed. 
That's all 
that's required of you. 
People-People overthink 
this life shit. 
People get all knotted up. 
"I don't know what to do 
with my life. 
"Like, I don't know, like, 
what I should be, or, like... 
"I don't know, it's like... 
What should I, like, do? 
With my 
With, like, my life?" 
Just get food 
and put it in the 
Put food in here. 
That's it. 
Put food in here. 
Walk around and look for food. And anytime you see 
any food, put it in here. 
Just take it and put it in here. Later, when you feel pressure, shit out the shit in there. 
That's it. 
If anybody tries to stop you 
Page 26/48
from doing either of those, 
murder them. 
That's it. 
Doesn't have to be 
any more complicated. 
Do it 'til you're died- 
'til you're dead. 
'Til you're dead, died, dead. 
I don't know how long 
I'm gonna live, I have no idea. You don't really ever get 
to find out. 
You never get to go, 
okay, I'm dead, so, 80. 
You don't ever get 
to have that thought. 
"This is it. " You get to go, 
"This is probably it." 
That's your last thought. 
"This is probably it 
right here." 
Yeah, well, we're all 
gonna die at some point. 
It's true, man. 
And you find out at some point It's an interesting thing 
about human beings, 
that we live with the knowledge that we're gonna die. 
I found out when I was seven 
that everybody dies. 
My grandfather told me. 
He said, "Everybody dies!" 
I wasn't even talking to him. 
I was just trying 
to blow out the candles. 
And I was seven years old when I found out that everybody dies. And I was excited, 
not 'cause everybody dies, 
but 'cause I knew it. 
I was excited 'cause I knew 
I was young to know 
that everybody dies. 
Page 27/48
I knew that most of my friends didn't know and I thought, 
I'm gonna tell them. 
I want to be the one 
that tells everybody. 
I especially 
wanted to tell Benjy, 
this kid across the street 
from me. 
There was this kid Benjy, 
he lived-I didn't 
He wasn't my friend. 
I was seven and he was six, 
but if I ever came out 
in my front yard, 
he would come out 
and I'd be like, ugh, 
here he comes. 
Just hated him. 
Hated him. 
First person I ever hated. 
Like, visceral hate. 
He was 
To me, he was a piece of shit 
cocksucker asshole. 
That's what he was to me, 
and I didn't even know 
any of those words. 
I just had that, 
like, as a raw feeling 
with no way to say it. 
I was too young 
for the feeling that I had, 
and then somebody 
I heard somebody say 
"piece of shit cocksucker 
asshole," I was like, 
that, yes, thank you. 
That's what that 
Yes, that's how-Yes. 
Anyway, one day 
I was in my front yard 
and piece of shit Benjy 
comes across. 
Page 28/48
And he says, "I got a new bike," or something like that. 
And I was like, uh, 
"You're gonna die someday." 
And he was like, 
"What? No, I'm not." 
I said, "Yes, you are. 
"Everybody dies. 
"You're gonna die 
and your mom's gonna die 
"and your daddy's gonna die. 
In that order." 
He was really upset 
and he starts running. 
It's still funny to me, 
it still makes me laugh, 
40 years later. 
I can still see it so clearly 
and it still makes me laugh. 
Run, Benjy! 
You can't run 
from this shit, bitch. 
It's gonna get you. 
I wonder if he's dead. 
Anyway. 
So he came back with his mom, 
his mom is so angry, 
and then I was scared. 
And his mom came over, 
"What did you say to him?" 
And I said, "I just told him 
that everybody dies." 
And she goes, "Well, 
that's not necessarily true." 
I was like, "What?" 
She says, "Well, some people 
die, but not everybody does." 
And I was so full of questions. I was like, what about 
What about Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, they're dead. But she said, "Yeah, 
"that's 'cause something 
happened to them. 
Page 29/48
"George Washington 
didn't take care of himself 
"and Lincoln got shot, 
but there's a lot of people 
alive from those days." 
And I was like, really? 
What about, like, Bible people? And she's like, "Yeah, I 
We have to go." 
And then she left, 
'cause I think she realized, 
this is only gonna get worse. 
She's not on a good side 
of this argument. 
And then I went to my mom 
and I told her the whole thing, she's like, don't worry, 
that lady's a fucking idiot, 
don't listen to her. 
My mom said, "Don't worry, baby, you're definitely going to die." Mm-hmm. 
Mm-hmm. 
People from the Bible. 
I wonder if people in the Bible knew they were gonna be 
in the Bible. 
Like, "You guys, this is totally gonna be in the Bible. 
"This is totally-You guys, 
"we're gonna get in the Bible, 
everybody. 
I gotta get my roots done 
so I look good for the Bible." Yeah, my dog died recently. 
I had to tell the kids 
that the dog is dead. 
That's a tough thing, telling 
your kids that the dog died. 
You gotta tell 'em 
at some point. 
You can't just keep going, 
What? No, he's-Where'd he go? 
Oh, look, there he goes. 
Page 30/48
I don't know, he's 
That little scamp. 
There he goes, go get 'em. 
Go get 'em! 
Told my kids the dog died 
and we dealt with it. 
And I was proud of them 
how they expressed 
their feelings about it. 
They cried. 
I was proud of them 
how they dealt 
with their feelings 
and what they said about 
it and how they processed it 
and I realized, this was 
a positive thing. 
That's how you start thinking 
as a parent, 
a lot of things you don't think would be positive really are, 
'cause-'cause a dog dying 
is an opportunity 
to deal with death 
with your kids. 
It's like a dry run for Grandma. It is, it is. 
Dog dies, you talk about it, 
you deal with it. 
Later on, you go, so, you know all that stuff we talked about? About the dog? 
Yeah, so, Grandma now. 
Mm-hmm. 
All the same stuff. 
That's right. 
All right, go brush your teeth. I had a dog when I was a kid 
and he hated me, 
and it really hurt. 
It's a true story, 
my dog hated me and I 
I wanted a dog so bad, 
I was, like, ten years old, 
Page 31/48
I used to beg my mother 
for a dog 
and she just would say, 
like, you had one 
when you were a baby 
and it died, it's fine. 
But finally, she said, 
you can have a dog 
if you keep your room clean 
for a month. 
And I was so excited, 'cause 
I was, like, I'm getting a dog. I told all my friends, 
I'm gonna get a dog. 
All I have to do is keep my room clean for a month. 
I lasted about a week 
and it just went to shit. 
I couldn't do it and then 
I tried, like, three, four days, I couldn't do it. 
And I got so depressed. 
I was like, I'm ten 
and I already know 
my life is gonna be shit 
'cause I can't do anything. 
And finally, my mom 
was like, just 
We'll get the dog, you're 
bumming everybody out. 
So she got us a dog. 
And the dog looked at me 
and he hated me, on sight. 
And I worked hard 
to take care of this dog. 
I was kind to him and he 
still hated me, which hurt. 
That's why it hurt. 
'Cause he must've just hated, 
like, who I am inside. 
He-You could tell how he felt, 'cause he was very expressive. 
He was a terrier, you know, 
so he had eyebrows. 
Page 32/48
Like, I'd walk in the room 
and he'd go, like, 
oh, fuck, I can't. 
And he would just leave! 
I would take him for a walk 
and I had to use a leash 
and I didn't want 
to use a leash. 
I wanted to be one of those 
cool guys with a dog 
that just comes along, 
you know one of those guys. 
He's always got, like, a suede jacket with patches in it. 
And, like, scratchy hair, 
he's like, hey. 
And he gets in his old pickup 
and he's like, come on, dog. 
He goes, like 
You know those guys that can 
whistle that cool whistle? 
Whatever. 
Whew! 
And the dog jumps in the back 
and they both get laid somewhere because they're both so cool. 
That's what I wanted. 
But my dog, we'd go for a walk and the leash was, like, taut, like this, it wasn't even like, yeah, we're friends. 
It was like, how far from 
this kid can I get my face? 
He would be choking himself 
the whole- 
"I hate you! 
I hate you!" 
And if I ever, like, slipped 
and dropped the leash, he 
He was like, I'm not your dog. He would just run. 
He would run like a slave, 
he would just take off. 
That's how he ran. 
Page 33/48
It's an apt description. 
That's how he ran. 
He didn't run like a deer. 
This is how a deer... 
He ran like this. 
He ran away so many times 
and then we'd get a call 
from the pound. 
"Hi, we have your dog." 
And you could hear my dog 
in the background, 
like, "Don't- 
"Seriously? 
I told you I don't wanna..." 
I've never been 
a big animal person. 
Some animals I hate. 
Uh, bats, I think bats 
are just disgusting. 
I hate bats. 
I hate-It's a rat 
with leather wings. 
You ever seen one and 
they, like, look around? 
It's like, somebody, you know? They have a face. 
It's disgusting. 
I hate bats. 
And I'm sure there's 
a whole thing of 
Oh, did you know that bats 
make all the French toast 
in the world, or whatever? 
I don't care. 
I hate them. 
I had a bad bat experience. 
This summer, I was, uh 
We rented a house this summer, I got a house for me 
and the kids. 
My ex wife and I 
We share custody of the kids, 
and so this summer, I had half One month they go with her, 
Page 34/48
one month with me, 
so I got a nice house 
in the country 
and it was beautiful, 
the kids loved it, 
but the kids go to sleep 
at, you know, 8: 
So I'm just laying awake, 
terrified. 
Terrified. 
I'm so scared in the country, 
'cause it's just quiet 
and it's just mystery. 
And trees and darkness. 
I live in New York City, 
I feel perfectly safe there. 
I'm surrounded by murderers 
and child molesters and Jews. 
Sorry. 
I mean, there are, 
there are a lot. 
There's a bunch of those, but... So... 
So one night, I'm in the country house and I'm just laying 
just laying awake, just begging for the fucking sun to come up so I can sleep through my days with the kids. 
And I'm laying awake and I'm 
My bedroom's 
above the kitchen and I 
Suddenly I hear this 
I swear to God, I heard 
this sound, I heard... 
I heard that, 
like, clear as a bell. 
And immediately, 
my heart is pounding. 
I'm like, I'm going to have 
a heart attack right now, 
because there is a witch 
in the kitchen. 
Page 35/48
First of all, there are witches. I have no doubt, in that moment, there's witches. 
That's how easy it was 
to flip me over. 
There are witches. 
And there's one in the kitchen, and I gotta go down there. 
I gotta-I can't just, eh, 
she'll get 
They like kids, 
she'll get the kids. 
So I go downstairs, 
I'm terr-Terrified. 
And I'm standing 
outside the kitchen door 
like this, for like, an hour. 
Too scared to go in, until 
a little bit of logic seeped in and told me, even if 
there is a witch in there, 
she wouldn't just make a noise and then just stand there 
for, like, an hour. 
So I go in, there's 
nobody in the kitchen. 
And then I hear the noise again, and it was the dishwasher. 
The dishwasher has weird tubes and when the soap goes 
through 'em, it's kind of vocal, I don't know why, but it goes... It was the weirdest thing, 
to watch my dishwasher do it. 
I was like, all right, 
it's cool. 
I'm fine, there's no witches. 
I'm about to go upstairs, 
and a 
And a bat, a fucking asshole bat picked that moment 
He's like, ha ha! 
And he just flew right 
right by my head, like this, 
Page 36/48
and I just-I went, "Aaah!" 
And I just fell on the floor. 
"Aaah!" 
And I immediately, 
I crawl into the closet, 
I closed the door and 
I called 911 right away. 
I don't know if you've 
ever called 911 
and you don't realize 
until they answer 
how you shouldn't be 
calling 911? 
"911, tell us your emergency." 
"I-I'm sorry, I'm very sorry 
to be bothering you. 
This doesn't qualify." 
The lady's like, 
"Sir, what's the problem?" 
I said, "There's a bat 
in my house. 
And I don't like it." 
But she was nice to me, 
'cause it's country 911. 
If you call 911 
in New York City, 
"there's a bat in my house!" 
They'll be like, "Sir, 
we'll send a car right over 
to shoot you in the face." 
But she was nice, she's like, 
"Sir, we understand, 
"you're divorced, 
you're overcompensating 
"with the country house. 
You're in over your head." 
She said, call this guy, 
she gave me a number, 
she said, call this guy, he's 
a guy who takes care of bats. 
He's a man who's, uh 
bats are his focus. 
I felt like she was doing a lot of work to not say "bat man." 
Page 37/48
Like she was kind of 
going around... 
"He's a male human 
who bats are his... 
I'm not gonna say bat 
I don't wanna say it." 
So I called the bat man... 
...and he comes over 
and I'm in the closet looking 
through the crack, at 
The bat is on the ceiling, 
hanging upside down, 
he's just looking around. 
The most disgusting thing. 
And so finally, there's 
a knock at my door and I go, 
I crawl to the door and 
I open it and he's like, hello. And he says, "Where's the bat?" And I'm like, "Ehhh..." 
So the guy walks over 
and he just takes the bat. 
That's it. 
He just took it. 
He's like, all right? 
Yeah, you pretty much nailed it. That's amazing. 
It's like I called somebody 
and said, "Help, 
there's a box of tissues 
on my table!" 
Oh, thank goodness. 
What a relief, to have 
a man in the house. 
Would you like some sweet tea? I wasn't expecting company. 
Ooh, my robe fell open. 
He saw my breasts. 
Ooh. 
What do we do now? 
Mr. bat man? 
You know, I'm kind of grateful to that bat now, 
now that you're going 
Page 38/48
to fuck me. 
You're not? 
Well, all right, 
you can go, then. 
I can't 
I can't get out of it. 
I'm sorry. 
I just like to keep doing that 'til the laughter stops. 
Fuck, he's really 
This is getting upsetting. 
What if I just did that 
for, like, 40 minutes? 
Well, if you weren't 
gonna help me, 
then why did you come over? 
I'm alone here all day and I 
hardly can handle it anymore. 
All right, all right. 
So... 
No, no. 
No, don't do that. 
Don't do that. 
I was, um... 
I was in New York one time, 
I was on the subway platform 
and I saw two rats, uh, 
and they were fucking. 
And I never saw that before. 
I'm like, oh, shit. 
There's two rats 
fucking right there. 
And so I watched 'em, um, 
'cause you can watch rats fuck. It's not a big deal. 
You don't have to go, like... 
You can really just 
totally just watch 'em. 
Hmm, I see. 
Anyway, I'm watching 'em, 
I'm just curious. 
I mean, it wasn't... 
surprising how they do it. 
It's not like she's on top 
Page 39/48
going, mmm. 
Mmm. 
Mmm, mmm, mm. 
Thank you. 
I love it, I love it. 
Ooh! 
I think this is a Japanese rat I'm doing, I don't know. 
"Ooh, it's so good to fuck you! Ohh! Come on, Ricky, 
do me!" 
I don't know, all right. 
Anyway, it wasn't 
anything like that. 
It was a pretty standard 
rat fuck. 
Just, he's on top, 
kinda smushing her 
into the pavement 
and she's like... 
And I'm watching 'em, just 
I mean, I didn't, like, 
miss my train. 
Just, while I was there. 
'Cause I was 
I was curious. 
It didn't turn me on, 
I was just curious. 
'Cause I want to know, what is 
it gonna be like when he comes. That's what I wanted to know. 
What is it like 
when a rat comes? 
Is it, like, uh 
Is it just a biological thing, just a dispassionate, 
kinda just, meh! And then 
he just goes home? 
Or is it like, 
"Yeah, fucking yeah!" 
Is it like, "Aww..." 
Is it, you know? 
Is it ecstasy? 
Is it an orgasm? 
Page 40/48
I told that story 
to a friend of mine. 
She was like, "Well, 
what about the girl rat? 
"What about her orgasm? 
Why didn't you empower her 
and wonder how she comes?" 
What, are you crazy? 
Girl rats don't come. 
There's no way the girl gets 
to come when rats fuck. 
First of all, he's not 
gonna hold out for her. 
He's not that kinda dude, 
you can tell. 
He didn't give a shit. 
He's gonna fuck her and leave, he doesn't even know her name. He's not sitting there 
waiting for her and trying 
to think of things to not come, like giant garbage bags with 
no food in them or whatever. 
And even if he did, 
she's on a subway platform 
in front of people. 
She's not gonna be able 
to get to that place, 
that inside place, 
that girl rats need 
to find their orgasm. 
'Cause I know 
what girl rats need. 
I know how to make 
a girl rat come. 
I do, you just pick 'em up and hold 'em upside down and just... Just to be clear, 
what I was doing there... 
I just want to make sure 
you know. 
I spit in her mouth 
while I played 
with her little asshole. 
Page 41/48

Don't judge her, 
that's what she likes. 
I did it for her. 
I was watching "The Wizard 
of Oz" with my daughters and 
I know that's 
I know that's, uh 
That's a weird couple of stories to put together. 
Fingering a rat's asshole 
to orgasm 
and watching "The Wizard of Oz" with my daughters, 
but they happened 
to have happened 
one right after the other. 
Most things that I do, I do 
right after I made a rat come. That's what I do at night. 
It's my 
It's the only way I try to help. All right. 
So I was... 
Let me just tell you this first. I was, uh, I was at a place to eating dinner in New York and 
I heard these two women talking and one of 'em is talking about the guy she's dating. 
They were about 21 years old, 
like, NYU students, 
and so she's talking about it 
and, you know, a lot of times 
I'll hear this, a woman talking about the guy she's dating 
and she runs down 
the stuff that's not satisfying, the things she doesn't like. 
She's like, "He's just, 
you know, I text him 
"and he, like, he doesn't, 
like, respond right away 
"and then, when he does, it's 
like, whatever, so that's weird. Page 42/48

"And then, like, I saw him 
and he's just being weird. 
"And so then he, like, calls me, he's like, I'm sorry I'm weird. "It's, like, weird, right now. 
And I was like, whatever. 
And then we had sex. 
And it's just weird." 
And then I'm listening 
'cause I wanted to know, 
what is her friend gonna say? 
I want to know what kind of 
friend she has, you know. 
And her friend just says, 
"He's a piece of shit. 
"He's a piece of shit. 
"He's not good enough for you, 
'cause you're amazing. 
"You're amazing. 
So he just can't handle 
how amazing you are." 
And I remember thinking, 
that is a shitty friend. 
That's not a good friend. 
That is not a good way 
to approach life. 
"I'm amazing! 
"And anybody who doesn't 
text me back is just 
can't handle 
how amazing I am." 
I mean, she's a student. 
She can't be 
She's not Nelson Mandela, 
she's in college. 
She-I'm sure she's fine, 
but you're amazing, 
the way you... take classes. 
What is 
What is so amazing? 
She's kinda boring, he's kind of a douche, so it's fine. 
They're fine. 
You need to know that 
Page 43/48
you're boring a little bit. 
It's important. 
Self love is a good thing, 
but self awareness 
is more important. 
You need to, once in a while go, oh, I'm kind of an asshole. 
You have to have 
that thought once in a while, 
or you're a psychopath. 
You know like when you say 
to a friend of yours, 
"You're being an asshole" 
and they're like, "No, I'm not." Well, it's not up to you 
if you're an asshole or not. 
That's up to everybody else. 
You don't get to say no to that. "You're an asshole." 
"No, I'm not." 
"Oh, sorry, I thought 
Okay, I'm glad I checked. 
I guess you're not." 
If somebody tells you 
you're an asshole, 
you should go, "Oh, shit." 
All right, what happened, 
how did I get here? 
It's like somebody saying, 
you know, 
"You got something 
on your face. " "No, I don't." It's like America 
I feel like America is, like, 
the world's worst girlfriend. 
America is like 
a terrible girlfriend 
to the rest of the world, 
'cause when somebody 
hurts America, 
she remembers it forever, 
but if she does anything bad, 
it's like it- "What?" 
"It did 
Page 44/48
I didn't do anything." 
America, why do you keep 
bombing those people in Yemen 
and all these- 
"Well, it's 'cause 9/11, okay? 
9/11, so shut up, assholes." 
Okay, but you killed 
hundreds of thousands of people, so I think you can- 
"Yeah, no, but 9/11. 
"Fuck you. 
You don't even understand." 
Yeah, but you're 
torturing people. 
"I-It wasn't even 
torture, oh, my God. 
"He's such a baby. 
I didn't even do anything 
to him." 
And... 
And I'm saying this about women 'cause I'm a guy. 
Women might say this about 
that this is what guys are like. That's just what it's like, 
you know, 
because I think racism 
and sexism are very different. To me, racism is just a mistake. It's like, just an error. 
It doesn't really make 
any sense, 
we can just do away with it, 
but sexism isn't going anywhere, 'cause sexism is way deep 
the fuck down inside, 
so it's just the way 
we feel about each other. 
It's, "Ahh, women! 
"Women! Women! 
"Women! 
Women! Women!" 
And you're like, "Men! 
"Men, men! Men! 
Page 45/48
"Men! 
"Men! Men! 
Men!" 
Anyway, so I'm watching "The 
Wizard of Oz" with my daughters. Is that enough of 
a palate cleanser? 
All right. 
I'm watching "The Wizard of Oz," I don't know if you've seen it, it's about a little girl 
named Dorothy, 
a very sweet little girl played by an alcoholic older lady, 
who, uh... 
Lives in Kansas, she has a dog, she's very upset. 
And she keeps telling- 
"My dog!" 
And everybody's like, 
This is a farm. We're working. Leave us alone. 
And then there's a tornado 
and they all run inside 
and they barely look for her. 
It's unbelievable. 
It was so upsetting to me when I was a kid to see this movie, 'cause Auntie Em is like, 
"Dorothy! Okay, fuck it." 
And she just goes right inside. Bolts the door. 
Unbelievable. 
So Dorothy goes up to Oz. 
So here's the thing, I was 
watching it the other night, 
and there's this one moment 
that really stunned me. 
It's when Ray Bolger, 
who played the Scarecrow, 
he just got ripped apart 
by flying monkeys 
and he's very upset 
and he has this performance 
Page 46/48
that's way over the top, 
even for this movie. 
Do you remember that moment? 
The Tin Man comes over. 
"What happened?" 
And he's like, 
"Well, first 
they tore my arms off 
"and they threw them over there! And then they tore my legs off and they threw them over there!" And I've seen this movie 
a thousand times, 
but for some reason this time, that moment made me go, 
"Oh, shit!" 
Ooh! 
That was a lot. 
And I started to wonder 
if Victor Fleming, 
the guy who directed 
"The Wizard of Oz," 
if he had a moment during 
the filming of the movie 
where he was, like, I think 
I gotta have a word with Ray, 
'cause that's getting 
to be a lot. 
All right, let him 
Just let him do another one. 
Okay, action! 
"What happened?" 
"Well, first they tore 
my arms off 
"and they threw them over there! "And then they tore my legs off. They threw them over there!" 
Okay, cut! 
Comes over. 
Uh... 
So listen. 
Ray... 
Yes? 
Eh, you're fine. 
Page 47/48
You guys have been great, 
thanks a lot for coming. 
I hope you enjoyed it. 
Thank you very much! 
Thank you!

- You have your key 
In there, sir? 
- Yeah. 
[Scattered cheers, shouting] 
- House lights? 
Go--wally, go on house lights. - You ready? 
- Spotlight. 
Spotlight. Spotlight. 
[Cheers and applause] 
- Thank you. 
Hi. 
Thank you very much. 
Uh, Thank you. 
Hello, everybody. 
Um, Hello. 
I mean, by everybody, 
I mean, uh, you guys. 
Uh, i mean 
Everybody who's here. 
Really i shouldn't 
Say "everybody," 
Because most people 
Are not here. 
By a pretty huge majority, 
Most people are not here. 
Most people are in China, 
Actually. 
It's true. 
Actually, that's not true. 
Most people are dead. 
Did you know that? 
It's true. 
Out of all the people 
That ever were, 
Almost all of them are dead. 
There are 
Way more dead people. 
And you're all gonna die, 
And... 
And then you're gonna be dead 
For way longer than your life. Like, that's mostly 
Page 2/70
What you're ever gonna be. 
You're just dead people 
That didn't die yet. 
That's... 
There are so many dead people. Ray Charles is dead. 
Hitler. 
Bunch of other ones. 
But mostly those two guys. 
And... 
It's true. 
Ray Charles and Hitler 
Are both dead. 
And really it's the only thing They have in common, 
Because otherwise 
They're very different dudes. 
Many contrasts between Hitler 
And Ray Charles. 
I'm gonna tell you 
A few of 'em. 
Um, Ray Charles was black. 
Hitler was not. 
Hitler killed several Jews. 
Too many. 
I'll say too many. 
He killed an excessive amount 
of Jews. 
He really... 
Beat that thing to the ground. He killed way-- 
He just--no moderation. 
Ray charles, meanwhile, 
Hardly any Jews. 
He killed so few Jews. 
Uh... 
I don't know 
How to start Shows. 
It's just a problem 
That i have. 
I never... 
I never figured out how to come Out and just start talking, 
Because the first thing 
Page 3/70
You say on stage 
Always feels stupid, 
Because there's no real reason For me to talk to you. 
It just doesn't exist. 
I don't know you. 
You don't--you're-- 
You don't even know each other. You're facing 
The same direction. 
That's all 
You have in common. 
So i just have to...Bleh! 
It's like talking 
To a girl at a bar 
Because 
You're attracted to her. 
The first thing you say 
Is just gonna be dog shit 
Coming out of your mouth. 
Because you don't know her. 
The only honest thing 
That you could say to her 
Is "i want 
To fuck your face." 
That's the only thing 
You could say 
That you could mean. 
Anything else you say 
Is you trying really hard 
Not to say 
"I want to fuck your face." 
That's the only thing you're-- "Hi, i want 
To put my penis in... 
The lowest hole 
In your head." 
I was never good at that. 
Like, i was very bad 
At being single, 
Which is a problem, 
Because i'm divorced, 
So i'm single again. 
After ten years 
Page 4/70
of marriage, and-- 
No, here. 
Cut the shit. 
Don't even start 
With that noise 
Like a puppy died. 
Let me tell you something. 
Let me tell you something. 
And this is important, 
Because someday one of your 
Friends is gonna get divorced. It's gonna happen. 
And they're gonna tell you. 
Don't go, "oh, i'm sorry." 
That's a stupid thing to say. 
It really is. 
First of all, 
You're making 'em feel bad 
For being really happy, 
Which isn't fair. 
And second--let me explain 
Something to you. 
Divorce is always good news. 
I know that sounds weird, 
But it's true, 
Because no good marriage 
Has ever ended in divorce. 
It's really that simple. 
That's never ha-- 
That would be sad, 
If two people were married 
And they were really happy, 
And they just had a great thing, And then they got divorced, 
That would be really sad. 
But that has happened 
Zero times. 
Literally zero. 
Ray Charles 
Has killed more Jews 
Than happy marriages 
Have ended in divorce. 
So if your friend 
Got divorced, 
Page 5/70
It means things were bad, 
And now they're-- 
I mean, they're better. 
They're not good. 
Life is shit wall to wall, 
But they're better, 
So you should be happy. 
But the part that's difficult 
Is being single at 41 
After ten years of marriage 
And two kids. 
It's--that's like 
Having a bunch of money 
In the currency of a country 
That doesn't exist anymore. 
Like... 
Like i found 500 million 
Prussian francs. 
I can't really take 
Advantage of being single, 
Because i didn't-- 
I didn't expect to be single. 
I'm not prepared. 
I didn't think i'd ever be-- 
I didn't keep 
This shit up. 
You understand? 
I didn't maintain 
Any of this 
At presentation condition. 
It's function only. 
It was not... 
I didn't think 
I would need it that way. 
I thought i was gonna be shoving It into the same person 
Every three months 
Till one of us died. 
That's... 
What i thought was the nature 
of the deployment for this... 
I didn't think 
I had to be, like, 
Appealing to someone 
Page 6/70
From scratch. 
It's like having a-- 
It's like having a '73 
Dodge dart in your backyard. 
And it's been sitting back there With grass growing-- 
You don't have any-- 
It's not an old mustang. 
You have no plans 
To restore that dart. 
You don't even see it 
When you look out the window. 
And now you find out 
That's your only way to work. 
You need that car now. 
And you're like, 
"Oh, shit, i-- 
"I didn't take-- 
It's got bees in it. 
"I didn't take care of it. 
"It's full of bees. 
"There's a family of mice 
Living in the tailpipe. 
I can't take that to work." 
I have no single instincts. 
I know too much to be single. 
I know everything 
That happens now. 
That's no good for single. 
You got to be optimistic 
To be single. 
Stupid. 
You have to be stupid. 
That's what optimistic means, 
You know? 
It means stupid. 
An optimist 
Is somebody who goes, 
"Hey, maybe something 
Nice will happen." 
Why the fuck would anything nice Ever happen? 
What are you, stupid? 
But that's the attitude 
Page 7/70
You have to be to be single. 
You have to look at somebody 
And go, "ooh, maybe..." 
I don't look at it that way, 
Even when i see somebody 
I'm attracted to. 
I was at a gym the other day. 
Why? Why? 
I'm at a gym. 
I'm just wearing shorts. 
That's all i'm doing there. 
Just standing there. 
And i look over, 
And there's a girl on the-- 
You know, with a ponytail, 
And she's on this thing-- 
And i'm looking at her, 
And i'm like, 
"Oh, she's awesome. 
Shit." 
But then i start thinking, 
Wait a minute. 
I'm single. I'm on the market. I have value. 
I could say something 
To her. 
I could just walk up 
And say something. 
And i'm trying to think-- 
"What am i gonna say?" 
What does--what do i look like To somebody like that? 
And then i realize 
It's been way too long. 
I've just been standing there, Staring at her. 
[Grunts] 
I want her! 
I have no identity 
In the single world. 
I can't--i look at them, 
I don't know what they're doing. I--i tried just jerking off 
Ito Girls Gone Wild 
Page 8/70
The other day. 
Just to re-enter 
The community that way. 
Just to feel part of it. 
And i bought it. 
Not the commercial 
On Comedy Central. 
I paid money like a grown-up. 
I put my credit card down 
And waited for it 
To come to my house. 
I'm an adult. 
Iso i'm trying to jerk off 
To Girls Gone Wild. 
I can't do it, 
'Cause i'm a father. 
I'm too old. 
I'm just getting mad 
At everybody in the video. 
I'm like, "you fucking 
Irresponsible bitches. 
Go back to school. 
What are you doing down there?" "There's two wars 
And a depression. 
"Put your--get the oil 
off your tits and study, 
For fuck's sake." 
I just don't look at a woman 
As a pair of tits anymore, 
And i wish i did, 
'Cause i could get laid easier, 'Cause that's what it takes. 
Just to go-- 
[Grunting] 
But i can't now. 
Like, i went to a club. 
I went to a club, 
You know, like, a... 
[Imitates thumping club music] Like, a club. 
And i'm standing there 
Looking at all the people, 
And there's the women-- 
Page 9/70
The hot chicks. 
The hot girl at the bar. 
You know when you see them, 
That's just--she's a hot girl 
At the bar. 
She's got the-- 
Got the shirt and the skirt, 
And the boots. 
Those three lines. 
It's, like, some 
Perfect ratio that they hit 
With those three lines, 
And you-- 
And they're all 
Standing there like that. 
And i used to look 
At somebody like that. 
I'm like, 
"Wow, she's an angel. 
What could i ever say 
To make her like me?" 
Now i look at her and i'm like, "What is that? 
"Is that even a person? 
"What the fuck 
Kind of person is that? 
Is that an identity even? 
Who would want to be that?" 
I have two daughters. 
I pray they don't 
Grow up to be the-- 
The hot girl at the bar. 
What kind of-- 
"Hey, what do you do?" 
"People want to fuck me." 
Really? That's it? 
"Yeah. 
"I go to this club, and they 
Want to fuck me over here. 
"Ha ha. 
Not you. 
Ha ha." 
And their male counterparts 
Are even more useless. 
Page 10/70
The guys. 
The dudes--the going out 
To get laid dudes. 
You know those guys 
That walk in packs of nine 
Down the bar street. 
The going out 
To get laid guys. 
They all got the same 
Button-up, stripy, 
Going out to get laid 
Shirt on. 
They all got the same stride, 
And there's one short 
Guy behind them like-- 
And they-- 
They're all out to get-- 
Like, who's gonna 
Fuck all nine of you? 
What is the fantasy here? 
Are you gonna see nine women 
In the same configuration, 
And just all--? 
Are you all gonna walk 
Into a giant vagina somewhere? "Ha ha! Dude!" 
And then later they're in front of a pizza place, 
Just angry at each other. 
"You said there was pussy there, You idiot!" 
"Shut up!" 
Then they beat up a stranger 
And get the energy out that way. "Faggot!" 
Those are the most 
dangerous people, 
Are dudes 
That didn't get laid. 
They're just fucking-- 
[Grumbles] 
Just full of come 
Coming out of their eyes. 
"Fucking--fucking-- 
Page 11/70
Fuck somebody." 
Stand there. 
I love dudes 
That hang out together 
And do the whole-- 
I saw this group of guys, 
And one of 'em was such a guy, He had it turned up so high 
That it was crazy. 
His friends 
Were kind of normal. 
He was like-- 
I'm like, "what? Is that-- 
That can't be real. 
That can't be a personality." 
Does he do that at 4:00 
In the morning 
When he's peeing 
And nobody's in his apartment? He's like-- 
And he kept doing that gesture That guys like to do. 
The... 
That's my favorite 
Dumb guy gesture. 
Yeah. Pfft. 
Pffsh, yeah, right. 
I always wonder, 
What if there was a guy 
Who, whenever he does this, 
He has to finish. 
Like, just some guy 
Who works in your office. 
You ask him a question. 
"Hey, is Bill in yet?" 
"Yeah, 
Like, he's ever on time." 
[Whispers] 
"Oh, fuck." 
[Cheers and applause] 
[Breathes heavily] 
"Oh, shit. 
"Seriously, that dude's 
Always late, man. 
Page 12/70
I'm serious." 
[Stammers] 
It's always an odd moment 
In a guy's life, 
The second after you come, 
And you're like-- 
[Shudders] 
Reality comes rushing back. 
'Cause you've been 
Pushing reality away 
In pieces 
All night to get the-- 
"Oh, no, it's fine. 
"Yeah, no, 
It doesn't matter. 
"No, i'll just 
Leave my car there. 
"It doesn't matter. 
I'll just go... 
"Doesn't matter... 
This is weird... 
Ah, fuck." 
And then 
You're just like-- 
You're like the Hulk coming 
back down to the other guy. 
My clothes are ripped 
And there's a dead guy here. 
I don't know what happened. 
I'm gonna get my duffle bag 
And leave town again. 
[Whistles] 
So this is 
A beautiful theater. 
I like what i do, 
Because i get to work 
In a lot of different places. 
And, uh, recently 
I did a show in New Jersey 
In the auditorium 
of a technical High School. 
I forgot that existed. 
technical High School. 
That's where dreams 
Page 13/70
Are narrowed down. 
That's-- 
'Cause we tell our children, 
"You can do anything you want." Their whole lives. 
"You can do anything." 
But at this place, 
We take kids-- 
Like, they're 15. 
They're young. 
And we tell them, 
"You can do eight things. 
We got it down 
To eight for you." 
And i'm not saying 
These people are stupid. 
Because i'm stupid. 
I really am stupid, 
And it bothers me. 
Like, 
I wish i was more stupid, 
'Cause then it wouldn't-- 
I would--just all 
My thoughts would just be-- 
[Murmuring] 
But instead, 
Here's how my brain works. 
It's stupidity 
Followed by self-hatred 
And then further analysis. 
It's not a very efficient 
System of thought. 
I have these dumb thoughts, 
"Duh," 
And then i go, "what the fuck 
Is wrong with you?" 
And then i figure it out. 
But the impulse 
Is always stupid. 
Like, i saw this guy 
In New York one day, 
And he's walking his dog, 
And this is what i saw. 
The guy's got a-- 
Page 14/70
He's got a coffee 
And a dog on a leash, 
And a phone. 
He's on the phone. 
So he's got 
His phone like this, 
And the dog's leash is going 
From the phone hand to the dog. And i look at this and i go, 
"Oh, he's got, like, 
A dog phone." 
Like, that thought 
Sincerely inhabited me 
For, like, a full minute. 
I'm going, "oh, i wonder 
What the benefits are 
To hooking 
Your phone up to a dog." 
And then the other part of me 
Had to go, 
"Why the fuck 
Would that exist? 
You asshole." 
I had a string of bad-- 
Dumb thoughts the other day. 
I was--i don't remember 
What town i was in. 
I was on the road. 
I was just standing 
In front of my hotel. 
It was 5: 
That's usually what i'm doing 
At 5: 
Just standing in front 
of my hotel. 
Because i've been 
Inside all day. 
Just with the jacking off 
And the ice cream. 
It's just horrible. 
It's, like, a horrible thing. 
All day. 
Page 15/70
Just depths of fucking hell. 
Just--i wake up, 
I get, like, chicken wings. 
Shit nobody eats 
At 10: 
Like, really--hot wings 
And i eat 'em all, 
And then i'm like, "uh..." 
So i get ice cream 
To cool it off, you know? 
Like... 
And then i feel worse, 
So i jack off and pass out. 
I turn off my phone 
In case my kids call. 
I can't fucking face anybody. 
I wake up covered with 
Three kinds of shame glaze 
Just covering my body. 
And so right around 5:00 
In the afternoon 
It starts getting dark, 
And i'm like, "i got to be 
In the daylight just once." 
I have to at least 
One time in the day 
Be in the daylight. 
And that's-- 
I just stand there. That's it. Like a fucking mental patient 
In a bathrobe. 
Just-- 
Cigarette burns 
On the robe and shit. 
Some girl telling me 
She got married. 
I'm not listening. 
"Daddy, 
This is my husband." 
That's what it feels like, 
Anyway. 
And i started 
Looking at people, 
Page 16/70
And they're all crispy-clothed And rosy-cheeked 
And full of purpose, 
And they're making me 
Feel worse. 
And i'm about to go back 
In the hotel 
And jack off another time. 
And then i look 
Across the street 
And i see this couple, 
And they were just striking. 
They were a beautiful couple. 
It was a beautiful woman 
With a beautiful man. 
I'll say he's beautiful. 
I got no problem with it. 
I'll suck his dick too. 
I don't need your permission. 
I don't care. 
Walk right over there 
And suck his dick. 
I mean, i never did that, 
But i'm 41. 
Maybe i'll do 
The second half gay. 
I don't know. 
It remains an option. 
There's got to be 
Something to it. 
Those folks 
Are having a good time. 
They have parades. 
They--there's no parades 
For how i get laid. 
They have parades. 
Marching down the street 
To celebrate that 
They blow each other 
And fuck each other 
In the ass. 
Smush their vaginas together, 
Or whatever that one is. 
Whatever wonderful thing 
Page 17/70
Those folks are doing 
That's none of my business. 
So i--okay, 
So i'm looking at the couple, 
And they're walking 
On the other side of the street, And they have a child with them. But i can't see their child, 
'Cause there's, like, 
A dumpster and some other stuff. I just see, like, 
A little head. 
And i'm waiting, i'm curious 
What their kid looks like, 
Because they're so beautiful. 
Maybe i want 
To fuck their kid. 
I don't know. 
[Laughs] 
That--that's just me 
Saying something terrible 
Because it makes me laugh 
That it upsets you. 
That's all that is. 
Just so you know. 
It's just--it's just enjoyable To me that you're upset. 
That's all it is. 
I'm not gonna fuck a kid. 
I wouldn't do that. 
Maybe a dead kid. 
Who are you hurting? 
He's dead. 
Who are you hurting? 
I'm not saying i would kill 
A kid and fuck him. 
I'm saying if i found 
A dead kid in a field 
And it wasn't raining, 
I might take a shot. 
I don't know. 
I haven't been 
In that situation. 
All right. 
Page 18/70
[Laughs] 
Oh, sorry. 
All right. Okay. 
So i'm looking 
At the couple, and... 
[Sighs] 
They got a kid with them, 
And i'm curious 
What their kid looks like. 
And they come 
Around the corner, 
And they're--and this 
Is a true story. 
It wasn't a kid. 
It was a little old chinese 
Woman walking next to them. 
And here's what 
My dumb brain tells me. 
I go, "oh, that's what 
Their child is like." 
Not like, "oh, she's 
A separate person. 
She's not with them." 
I'm like, 
"Oh, that young couple 
"Gave birth to a tiny, 
Elderly chinese woman. 
Isn't that interesting?" 
And then the other 
Part of me had to go, 
"Dude, you-- 
"Yeah, that's what happened. 
Yes. 
Asshole." 
And then i was looking 
At the little old chinese lady. She was--there was 
A beauty to her. 
She's just tiny, little, 
Old ch-- 
I was staring at her 
'Cause i was fascinated by her. I don't know anybody like her, And i am so not 
Page 19/70
A little old chinese lady. 
That i--i was like, 
"What are her thoughts?" 
That was what 
I was burning inside with. 
What is she thinking 
Right now? 
I can never know. 
And i really--the dumb brain 
Is telling me 
That she's just thinking-- 
[Imitates chinese] 
That's how dumb i am. 
That i think chinese 
Gibberish that i made up... 
Is in her 
Actually chinese mind. 
That's all. 
Just-- 
"Me chinese." 
[Imitates chinese] 
Course i didn't--i can't know 
What she was thinking. 
She could be thinking 
Anything. 
"Eh, black people steal." 
So i'm like-- 
She might-- 
I'm not saying they steal. 
I'm saying that fucking 
Racist chinese lady 
Might have been thinking it. 
She might have been. 
It's possible. 
And i went to England. 
I spent a month there. 
I liked England. 
Everything's different. 
I mean, that's obvious, 
But some of 
The differences were cool. 
I like the money, 
The money-- 
Instead of a dollar bill 
Page 20/70
They have the pound coin. 
And it's a coin and 
You throw it on the counter. 
It felt kind of cool. 
Like the old west. 
Like going on the--you know, 
Being on the dusty trail. 
You see a saloon, so you walk 
Over to it with your horse. 
You throw the rope 
Vaguely at the pole outside. 
That thing they do. 
It's my whole life 
On that horse. 
Should be fine. 
Just... 
Walk in the saloon. 
"Give me a beer, 
The bottle of whiskey, 
"And a room for a week, 
"Steak dinner, shave 
And a haircut and a bath, 
"And some new clothes 
And a hat and some boots, 
And some oats for my horse, 
And a woman." 
Here you go. 
Ping. 
That's all. 
One heavy coin. 
You're fine. 
Nobody adds up all those things You mentioned. 
They don't check 
To see what coin it was. 
The guy just keeps 
Drying the glass. 
Things were very vague 
Back then. 
Things just cost money. 
"Hey, how much is that?" 
"Money." 
In the old english movies, 
It was different. 
Page 21/70
It was a little sack of coins. Remember that little 
Drawstring sack 
Tossed over 
By some faggy lord 
With a ruffled shirt. 
Throw it disdainfully down 
To some commoner 
Who's gonna do something 
Beneath his station. 
"Follow the girl and report 
Back to me at midnight. 
"Bring a shovel and a sack 
"And two reliable men 
Such as yourselves. 
"Oh, what's that? 
Oh, yes, of course. 
Well, 
This ought to be sufficient." 
Meh, just--shink. 
"Oh, thank you, sir." 
The guy's so happy 
To get a general amount 
of some kind 
of currency or another. 
He didn't, like, count it. 
Like, "i think you only gave me Enough for the shovel. 
There's not enough there." 
That was a good time 
In our economy, 
When you needed to have gold 
To buy shit. 
We might be going back to that Pretty soon too. 
Things are pretty fucked up. 
People are a little bit scared. But you know what? 
How bad could it really get? 
I mean, most Americans 
Have so much crap 
You could lose most of it 
And still be-- 
Have more shit 
Page 22/70
Than the average Canadian, 
Even. 
Like, we're the fattest 
People in the world, 
And we just have 
All this shit, 
And we hate it. 
We're just miserable 
With our phones. 
"Fucking..." 
[Murmurs] 
Just angry all the time. 
And i worry about 
The economy failing, 
Because we don't-- 
We can't even-- 
We're miserable 
With a great life. 
Like, i don't know 
How the fuck 
We're gonna deal with, like, 
When you got to move your mom 
Into the cellar and shit 
And, like, have, like, 
Serious problems. 
Because we have, like-- 
Up till now, 
We have white-- 
We have white people problems 
In America, 
That's what we have. 
White people problems. 
You know what that is? 
That's where your life 
Is amazing, 
So you just make shit up 
To be upset about. 
People in other countries 
Have real problems. 
Like, "oh, shit, 
They're cutting off 
All our heads today." 
Things like that. 
Here we make shit up 
Page 23/70
To be upset about. 
"Like, how come i have to choose A language on the atm machine? It's bullshit." 
"I shouldn't have to do that. 
I'm American." 
God, the shit 
We bitch about. 
I called American Airlines, 
And i got a xstani lady. 
And she was in Pakistan. 
Only people near my fat, 
White body should have jobs. 
I'll tell you what, though. 
When i call American Airlines 
And i get the Pakistani lady, 
I hang up and i call again. 
I do. 
I'm gonna tell you honestly. 
And it's not because 
I don't like her, 
And it's not because 
She doesn't speak english, 
'Cause she speaks 
Way better than i do. 
She's just a better person. 
It's so clear. 
And i know--here's why 
I don't like talking to her. 
'Cause i know she doesn't 
Give a shit 
About me and 
My white people problems. 
I want to talk 
To the lady from Texas, 
Who's-- 
"Well, how can i help you?" 
That's the lady i want. 
I just know when i-- 
[Pakistani accent] 
"Hello, American--" 
"Oh, fuck. 
You don't care." 
There's no way. 
Page 24/70
Why would you? 
I'm in my underwear. 
"Hi, i have a layover 
In Dallas that's really long, 
And i was wondering if--" 
And she's like, 
"Oh, really? 
"I haven't had a clean glass 
of water in ten years, okay? 
"Two of my kids 
Died this morning. 
"I still came to work, 
You fat shit. 
"I can hear your fat 
Over the phone. 
Why don't you hang up 
And kill yourself?" 
Why would she care? 
But we just--God. 
Standing at the atm. 
"I can't believe 
They make me go like this. 
Stupid." 
What the fuck 
Are you complaining about? 
You push a button and money 
Comes out a fucking slot. 
It didn't used to be that way. When i was younger, 
You had to go in the bank. 
Remember that? 
You had to go inside the bank. Now you look in the bank, 
You're like, "what are those 
People doing in there? 
Are they cleaning? 
The money's out here." 
It's amazing how different 
Shit is now, 
And it hasn't been this way 
For a long time. 
It's been a very short time. 
Everybody has a phone 
In their pocket. 
Page 25/70
It didn't used to be 
You had a phone-- 
Just a few years ago, 
Nobody had their phone. 
It was just the phone. 
It was this thing, the phone, 
That was in a room 
In your house. 
And then you had to dial 
This fucking thing. 
There was a rotor, 
And you had to turn it 
And go-- 
[Imitates rotary phone] 
You actually hated people 
With zeros in their numbers, 
'Cause they made you do-- 
Well, this guy's got 
A zero and a nine. 
How badly do i want to talk 
To that piece of shit? 
That's too much work. 
Now we have this, 
Which is amazing. 
We have these phones that you 
Can call in an air strike. 
You can look at the top 
of your own head. 
It's amazing, this shit, 
And it's wasted 
On the shittiest generation 
of piece of shit assholes 
That ever fucking lived. 
I swear to God. 
We are. 
We're the worst people so far. Because we have 
This beautiful thing, 
And we hate it. 
We're just-- 
"Fucking thing." 
I don't-- 
Never saw a person going, 
"Look at what 
Page 26/70
My phone can do." 
Nobody does that. 
They all go-- 
"Fucking thing, it sucks. 
I can't get it to--" 
Give it a second, 
Would you? 
Could you give it a second? 
It's going to space. 
Can you give it a second 
To get back from space? 
Is the speed of light 
Too slow for you? 
You non-contributing, 
Product sponge cunt? 
Can you just wait? 
Can you just take 
A little breath? 
Just wait for that picture of 
Axl rose to get on your phone. Like it even fucking mattered 
What you were doing. 
Like it was even important. 
We're all just so mad. 
"I hate my phone. 
It sucks!" 
No, it doesn't. 
It's amazing. 
The shittiest cell phone 
In the world 
Is a miracle. 
Your life sucks 
Around the phone. 
Why are you so mad at it? 
People say 
The craziest shit. 
"I--i hate Verizon." 
What are you talking about? 
How can that feeling exist? 
"I hate Verizon!" 
"Why? Did they fire you 
And take away your pension?" 
"No, it just--couple of times 
It was weird for a second." 
Page 27/70
[Grumbles] 
"I hate them!" 
Hate Verizon. 
Well, make your own, then. 
You go make one. 
Make your own network. 
Get some hubcaps 
And climb some trees. 
See how close 
Yours is to perfect. 
Why would it be perfect? 
Really, 
It's as good as it is. 
Why do we expect it 
To be fucking perfect 
All the fucking time? 
We're not contributing. 
We're not helping it be perfect. We don't even know what-- 
What is involved. 
Do you have any idea 
What is involved 
In taking your thing 
That you said 
That nobody needs 
To ever hear ever, 
When you go-- 
"Hey, what's up, dude." 
[Blows raspberry] 
And a little, invisible, 
Magic angel takes it, and-- 
[Whooshes] 
God damn it. 
Ho--"when did you 
Send me that text?" 
If i sent it to you 
A month ago, it's amazing. 
Whenever it gets to you, 
It's amazing. 
Whenever it gets to you 
It's incredible. 
I don't know. 
I'm not that old. I'm 41. 
But i'm still amazed 
Page 28/70
At the shit in my life. 
I'm amazed at the shit 
In the world. 
I was on a plane once, 
Like about a month ago, 
And they had high-speed, 
Wireless internet on the plane, And they had never 
Done that before. 
They explained to us 
That we were, like, 
One of the first aircraft. 
And i opened up my laptop, 
And i'm online. 
I'm looking 
At youtube and shit 
While we're flying. 
And then it broke down. 
And the woman says, "i'm sorry, But we have to fix the internet, So it's down 
For the rest of the flight." 
The guy next to me goes, 
"It's fucking bullshit." 
I'm, like, "dude, how does 
The world owe you something 
You didn't even know existed 
People on planes 
Are the worst. 
People on planes, 
They complain. 
They get off the plane, 
They come to your house, 
And they tell you about 
Your whole flight experience. 
And they make it sound 
Like it was fucking a-- 
A cattle car 
In Poland in the '40s. 
They just make it-- 
"That was the worst 
Day of my life. 
"I had to sit on the runway 
For 40 minutes." 
Page 29/70
That's a story 
In this country. 
That's a fucking hardship, 
That you had to sit 
On the runway. 
People will listen 
To that story. 
They'll stop doing the dishes 
And turn around and go, 
"Oh, my God, really? 
For 40 minutes? 
That's awful. 
You should sue them." 
"I had to sit on the runway 
For 40 minutes." 
Oh, my God, really? 
What happened then? 
Did you fly through the air 
Like a bird? 
Incredibly? 
Did you soar 
Into the clouds impossibly? 
Did you partake 
In the miracle of human flight? And then land softly 
On giant tires 
That you couldn't 
Even conceive 
How they fucking 
Put air in them? 
How dare you. 
Bitching about flying. 
"I had to pay 
For my sandwich." 
You're flying! 
You're sitting in a chair 
In the sky. 
You're like a greek myth 
Right now. 
"But it doesn't 
Go back very far, 
And it's sort of 
Squishing my knees." 
The Wright Brothers would 
Page 30/70
kick us all right in the cunt 
If they knew. 
If--if you could go back 
In time to Orville Wright 
And go, "hey, dude, i had to sit On the runway for 40 minutes." And he'd be like, 
"Oh, shit, 
Well, let's 
Not even bother, then." 
"Hey, Wendell, shut it down. 
"They make you wait for a bit. That hardly seems worth it." 
There's always delays. 
That's what everybody 
Complains about. 
There's always delays 
When i fly. 
Really? Delays. 
It's too slow. 
Air travel's too slow. 
New York to California 
In six hours. 
That used to take 30 years, 
To do that, 
And a bunch of you would die 
On the way there. 
You'd get shot in the neck 
With an arrow and you'd go-- 
[Gags] 
And fall down. 
And the other passengers 
Would just bury you 
And put a stick there with your Hat on it and keep walking. 
And one of 'em 
Would fuck your wife 
And have three babies. 
And all the old people 
Would die. 
You'd be a whole different 
Group of people 
By the time 
You got to California. 
Page 31/70
Now you watch 
An Adam Sandler movie 
And you take a big, runny dump And you're there. 
I was, uh, i was flying 
About a week ago, 
And, uh, i was in the airport, And i saw this really old man, And he's on-- 
He's on a wheelchair. 
I can fucking hear 
That shit, 
So back the fuck off. 
I can hear 
It in your headsets. 
Just careful. 
Or turn them down. 
Sorry to fuck up 
The entire show for that, 
But i could hear-- 
[Imitates earpiece chatter] 
"Get closer to him. 
"No, it's okay, it's fine. 
Get closer to him. 
He won't mind." 
All right. 
Wait a second. 
[Cheers and applause] 
Okay, uh, 
This about where i was? 
Okay. 
[Audience member shouts] 
That's right. 
I was on a-- 
I was in the, um... 
I was in the airport. 
Ugh... 
Tot--just drenched right now. 
Totally drenched. 
It's like i peed. 
It's crazy. 
Okay, so i'm in the airport, 
And i'm going through security, And they bring this old man 
Page 32/70
In a wheelchair, 
And he was... 
Crazy old. 
I mean, he was the oldest thing I've ever seen. 
I've been 
To museums and shit. 
This dude... 
I didn't know 
There had been as much time 
As this guy was old. 
I mean, 
He was at least forever. 
He was at least that old. 
Just tiny, 
Little nosferatu hands 
And eggy head. 
Just one of those... 
So frail. 
It was like 
Just the atmosphere 
Was crushing him 
Into a diamond. 
Just... 
[Screeches] 
And they're 
Pushing him through, 
And i'm not the only per-- 
Like, 
He was parting the people, 
'Cause people were going, 
"What the fuck? 
That's crazy. 
He's really old!" 
And they take him 
Through security, 
And, you know, 
If you're really old 
Or you're in a wheelchair, 
You can't go through 
The metal detector 
If you're in a wheelchair, 
So they take you 
To secondary clearance, 
Page 33/70
Which is far more stringent. 
Like, the oldest and feeblest 
People get the highest scrutiny. So they take him over there, 
And he's--i mean, he doesn't 
Even look good for infinity. 
He's not even like, a-- 
He's, like-- 
Got a whole thing going. 
And they take him over, 
And they start checking him 
For weapons. 
Like, thor--like, 
What do you got there, huh? 
Like, checking him. 
And they lift him-- 
I swear to God, 
They picked him up 
Gently out of the wheelchair 
By the shoulders, 
And he's standing between 
These two guys like this, 
And they're going-- 
[Imitates beeping] 
And i'm like, "really? 
Is that the guy, fellas? 
"You think that's the guy? 
Do you want to maybe 
Let him go?" 
Let him enjoy the last 
Ten seconds of his life 
Doing something else. 
What--what is he gonna-- 
Even if he pulled it off, 
He deserves whatever he wanted, Really. 
What is he gonna do? 
Even if he had a grenade-- 
Let him keep it. 
And i know what they'd say. 
They'd be like, "well, 
Where do you draw the line?" 
He--this is the line. 
This guy right here, 
Page 34/70

He's the actual line. 
It's very clear. 
There's always somebody going 
Through security who's like, 
"I don't want 
To take off my shoes. 
"Stupid. 
I'm not a terrorist." 
Oh, that's right. 
We only make 
Terrorists do that. 
I'm sorry. 
[Grumbles] 
That's what we sound like now. [Grumbles] 
Just the whole country. 
We're like 
Fat eighth graders. 
All of us. 
Just-- 
Not fair. 
You ever listen to people? 
When i was in England, 
I went into this cafe 
Full of AfghaniJ people, 
And they're--they just had 
Crackly energy 
To their language. 
I don't know 
What they were saying, 
But it was like-- 
[Imitates language] 
There's energy. 
We don't have that anymore. 
You ever listen to people? 
You ever listen to what 
People really sound like? 
The other day i was 
In some whatever coffee-- 
I don't know, 
You can only be in six places. Whichever one i was in. 
And i'm listening to just fat 
White people talk to each other. Page 35/70
These two fat white guys 
Behind me. 
One of 'em is like... 
[Mumbling, slurring] 
And his friend's like, 
"I know, it's... 
[Mumbling, slurring] 
...Obama." 
These two women are talking. 
One of them's like... 
[Higher-pitched mumbling, 
Slurring] 
"I know, it's..." 
[Higher-pitched mumbling, 
Slurring] 
"...Stephanie." 
Anyway, i was listening 
To the two guys, 
And one of 'em used a word 
That really pissed me off, 
Because it was how he used it. He used the word 
"Hilarious." 
That's one of those words 
That we use-- 
That we don't care 
What it means. 
We go right for the top shelf 
With our words now. 
We don't think about 
How we talk. 
We just say the-- 
Right to the fucking just-- 
"Dude, it was amazing. 
It was amazing." 
Ireally? 
You were amazed? 
You were amazed by 
A basket of chicken wings? 
Really? 
Amazing. 
What are you gonna-- 
What are you gonna do 
With the rest of your life now? Page 36/70

What if something 
Really happens to you? 
What if Jesus comes down 
From the sky 
And makes love to you 
All night long, 
And leaves the new, 
Living lord in your belly? 
What are you gonna call that? 
You used "amazing" 
On a basket of chicken wings. 
You've limited yourself verbally To a shit life. 
All these words we use. 
"Genius." 
That's-- 
You can--anybody 
Can be a genius now. 
It used to be 
You had to have a thought 
No one ever had before, 
Or you had to invent a number. Now it's like, "hey, i got a cup In case we need another cup." 
"Dude, you're a genius." 
So these guys, 
They used "hilarious." 
And i remember 
The context exactly, 
Because i had 
The hate recorder 
Running in 
The back of my head. 
I was just standing there 
Fucking angry. 
I'm listening to 'em. 
One guy says to the other guy, He goes, uh, 
"Hey, dude, so, uh... 
[Breathes heavily] 
So guess who i saw today." 
And his friend goes, 
"Who?" 
I swear to God 
Page 37/70
That's how he said it. 
It just slid out. 
Just "who?" 
I was like, 
"Tighten your lips up, man. 
Make an effort." 
"Who." 
That's how a person talks. 
This guy, 
He's just secreting words 
Out of the front of his head. 
"Who?" 
[Sputtering, slurring] 
So his friend goes, 
"I saw Lisa today." 
And he goes, 
"That's hilarious." 
How the fuck 
Is that hilarious? 
That you saw Lisa. 
Is Lisa a poodle 
On her hind legs? 
How is that hilarious? 
Was she standing next to 
Jerry Lewis when he was younger? How the fuck 
Is that hilarious? 
Do you know 
What "hilarious" means? 
"Hilarious" means so funny 
That you almost went insane 
When you heard that sh-- 
It's just so funny 
That it almost ruined your life. You're homeless now because 
You can't cope or reason anymore Because that hilarious thing 
Just shattered your mind, 
And three months later you got Shit and leaves in your hair, 
And you're drenched 
In pee in the gutter. 
That's how funny 
"Hilarious" is. 
Page 38/70
I don't know 
This Lisa cunt, 
But she ain't that funny. 
There's just no way. 
She's that funny on sight? 
Fuck her. 
Seriously. 
I hope she's dead. 
I really do. 
I hate her. 
I hope she died today. 
Weirdly and horribly. 
I hope the person 
She loved most 
Pushed her off a cliff, 
And she was just falling and 
Screaming the whole way down, 
Never accepting it. 
And then Superman 
swooped her up 
And then dropped her 
from higher. 
[Laughter and applause] 
I seriously hope 
That happened... 
To stupid Lisa. 
With her one tit 
bigger than the other, 
And her fucking frizzy hair, 
And her... 
Her big nose. 
Fucking Jew. 
[Laughter] 
What am i doing? 
I've lost my mind. 
"Jew" is a funny word, 
Because-- 
It is. 
Because "Jew" is the only word That is the polite thing 
to call a group of people 
And the slur 
for the same group. 
Most groups 
Page 39/70

have a good and a bad-- 
Theirs, the same word, 
Just with a little stank on it, And it becomes a terrible 
Thing to call a person. 
'Cause you can say. 
"He's a Jew." It's fine. 
Ibut "he's a Jew." 
Like, that's all it takes. 
I wish the president 
Would slip one into a speech 
That's just on the border, 
Just to fuck 
With people's heads. 
Just in the middle, 
You know. 
"We all got to get along 
In this country. 
"We need everybody. 
I"blacks and whites 
And christians and Jews, 
And let's just try to..." 
Hmm. 
I don't... 
Can't call him on it, 
But that seemed inappropriate. Fucking Lisa. 
Fucking Lisa, man. 
It's just-- 
It didn't deserve that. 
The story didn't deserve-- 
Here's what he should have said. This is what 
That story deserved. 
It should have been like, 
"I saw Lisa today." 
The other guy should have said, "That happened." 
That's it. 
That's all it deserved. 
He should have said, 
"That happened," 
And then they just 
Should have started making out. Page 40/70

I don't know why i wanted that. I just wanted these 
Two old fat guys 
To just start blowing 
Each other on the floor. 
Not even gay blowing. 
Just awkward, 
Heterosexual sucking, 
That they don't know 
What they're doing. 
And they don't even get hard 
Partway through. 
They're just sucking 
Each other's soft penises. 
And they're both crying, 
'Cause they're embarrassed 
And confused. 
Now that would be hilarious. 
Then you would have a story 
That you could call hilarious 
Without being accused 
of hyperbole. 
It's amazing, the stories that People think are interesting. 
And that's always one of 'em, 
Is when your friend ran 
Into somebody from their past, And they can't 
Wait to tell you. 
And first they want 
To tell you for 40 minutes 
How blown away you're gonna be That they saw this person. 
"Dude, you're not gonna believe Who i saw today." 
Yes, i am. 
Course i am. 
Don't even tell me. 
I don't care. 
"No. No, dude. 
"Dude! 
"When you find out-- 
Holy shit! 
"When you find out who i saw, 
Page 41/70
"You are gonna shit in your 
Father's mouth when i tell you. "I'm serious! 
"When i tell you who i saw, 
"You are gonna 
Kill, fuck, and eat 
"Four mexican retarded kids 
When i tell you who i saw today. "I'm s--you're gonna do that. 
"I'm serious 
That you're gonna do that. 
"You're not gonna-- 
"You're just gonna 
Rip out your asshole 
"And throw it on the wall. 
"It's gonna stick there, 
"And you're gonna 
Dive through it 
Into another dimension." 
[Laughs] 
Tell you who i saw today. 
Anyway, i don't know 
Why i'm such an asshole. 
I really am. 
I have--i'm grumpy. 
I don't--i get impatient 
With people quickly, you know? I just get tired of-- 
When people are boring, 
I want to kill them, you know, And that's not fair. 
I used to like people more, 
But now i have children, 
And that changes your life. 
It changes your life 
In a lot of ways. 
Like, you spend 
A lot of time with people 
You never would have chosen 
To spend time with. 
Not in a million years. 
I spend whole days 
With people i'm like, 
"I never would have 
Page 42/70
Hung out with you." 
I didn't choose you. 
Our children chose each other 
Based on no criteria, 
By the way. 
They're the same size. 
They don't give a shit 
Who they make me 
Hang out with. 
My daughter had 
A playdate the other day. 
This kid comes over, 
And his father brings him, 
And his father 
Brings his fucking face 
Into my house. 
And i have to ask it questions For an hour and a half. 
"Ugh. What do you do? 
I don't care. 
"God damn it. 
"What other shit 
Are you passing on 
"To that little faggot 
You brought over here 
"To play with my kid? 
"I don't--i hate your son. 
"I hate him. 
He smells." 
Gets too close 
When he talks. 
"Can i have raisins?" 
Yes, you can have-- 
Just...Stand... 
Dude, i'm not-- 
You're not mine. 
I don't love you. 
Do you understand? 
I don't have any--no love. 
None. 
I don't even have an instinct 
To protect you. 
I don't care if you die. 
I seriously--i won't 
Page 43/70
Feel anything if you die. 
I'll have to pretend. 
For your dad. 
I like kids. 
Parents, i'm not crazy about. 
Most parents-- 
Like, this whole country, 
Our thing is the children. 
We have to do it all 
For the children. 
And, meanwhile, 
Nobody gives a shit 
About how 
They raise their kids. 
People put minimal effort 
Into it. 
They have--their kids-- 
They're, like, 
Consumers of their kids. 
Like, they want to call 
Customer service. 
"Why does he play 
Video games all day? 
I don't understand 
Why he plays video--" 
Maybe 'cause you bought him 
A fucking video game, 
You idiot. 
Throw it a-- 
Throw it away! 
Who told you 
That was a good idea? 
A developing mind. 
[Grunts] 
Fucking idiots. 
My kids don't even 
Watch television. 
And when i tell 
Most other parents that, 
You know what they say? 
They go, 
"Aw, fuck you." 
Why? 
"Just 'cause fuck you. 
Page 44/70
"Fucking hippie weirdo. 
"They're gonna 
Grow up weirdos. 
"'Cause they don't watch 
Just fucking anger and colors 
Screaming in their face." 
[Screams] 
If your kids watch tv, 
Here's what you should do. 
Just--if you think 
That's really a good idea 
To have 'em watch tv, 
Next time your kid's 
Watching television, 
Just come up behind them when 
They don't know you're there, 
And just turn it off 
Without any warning. 
Just go--pfft. 
Watch what happens. 
They go-- 
[Screams] 
Do you think 
That's a good sign? 
You think it's a sign 
That it's healthy for them? 
That when it's taken away 
They go-- 
[Mutters] 
Because you've created 
Such a high bar of stimulus 
That nothing competes. 
A beautiful day is shit 
To a child now. 
A gorgeous, panoramic day 
With hawks catching fucking mice And flying away 
And bears with fucking fish 
In their teeth. 
And the kid's like, 
"I want to watch the television! This is nothing!" 
That's what's wrong 
With our kids. 
Page 45/70
They can't just stand 
And be a person without-- 
Baa! Blah! 
And then the food-- 
We feed them food 
That tastes like insanity. 
It's insanity, our food. 
Do you under--you should 
To be able to give a kid 
An apple, and they go, 
"Oh, thank you. 
I love apples." 
Kids can't even taste-- 
Apples are like paper to them. Because we fill 'em, 
We force them to eat-- 
People force their kids 
To eat fast food. 
I was in this hamburger-- 
This woman's, like, just 
Shoving french fries in the-- 
"Eat it!" 
The kid's, like, 
"Mom, it's salty. It hurts. 
I can't eat anymore." 
"Shut up. 
Have a soda." 
We give them msg, 
Sugar, and caffeine, 
And, weirdly, 
They react to those chemicals. And so they yell, "aah." 
And then we hit them. 
What fucking chance 
Does a kid have? 
We pump the stuff in there. 
"Aah!" 
"Shut up! 
"Stop it. 
Why are you like this?" 
"'Cause i haven't had actual 
Nutrition in eight years, mom. "I'm dehydrated. 
"Give me water. 
Page 46/70
"Pepsi's not water, 
You cunt. 
"Give me a glass of water. 
"I'm dying. 
I have sores on my tongue 
All the time." 
"And stop hitting me. 
"You're huge. 
"How could you hit me? 
That's crazy. 
You're a giant, 
And i can't defend myself." 
I really think it's crazy 
That we hit our kids. 
It really is--here's the crazy Part about it. 
Kids are the only people 
In the world 
That you're allowed to hit. 
Do you realize that? 
They're the most vulnerable, 
And they're the most destroyed By being hit, 
But it's totally 
Okay to hit them. 
And they're the only ones. 
If you hit a dog, 
They fucking will put you 
In jail for that shit. 
You can't hit a person 
Unless you can prove that 
They were trying to kill you. 
But a little, tiny person 
With a head this big 
Who trusts you implicitly, 
Fuck 'em. 
Who gives a shit? 
Just fucking-- 
Let's all hit them. 
People want you 
To hit your kid. 
If your kid's making noise, 
They'll be like, 
"Hit him! Hit him! 
Page 47/70
"Hit him! 
[Growls] 
Hit him!" 
That's right. 
We're proud of it. 
We tell-- 
"I hit my kids." 
That's what people say 
All the time. 
"You're damn right 
I hit my kids." 
"Why--why do you hit them?" 
"'Cause they were doing a thing I didn't like at the moment, 
"And so i hit them, 
And guess what? 
They didn't do it after that." Well, that wouldn't be taking 
The fucking easy way out, 
Would it? 
How about talking to 'em 
For a second, 
You fucking retard? 
How do you f-- 
How is that-- 
How is that the-- 
What are you, an idiot? 
What are you? 
A fucking ape? 
"Well, i don't-- 
It's a pain in the ass." 
Well, you fucked a woman, 
And a fucking baby 
Came out of her vagina. 
Now you be patient. 
It's not their fault. 
"Well, i'm teaching 'em 
That you hit things." 
"It's learning the world. 
"You hit him, 
And he'll know... 
"That i'm stronger than him, 
"That it hurts when my hand 
Hits his face. 
Page 48/70
"He'll know. 
"He'll get some wisdom 
Out of that. 
Raising 'em right." 
God damn it. 
Look, though, 
Let me say this. 
If you have kids 
And you do hit your kids, 
I totally get it. 
I'm not judging. 
Let me just explain. 
I get it. 
Because my mom hit me. 
She hit me all the time. 
I don't hit my kids. 
I'm not better than my mom. 
It's 'cause she was poor 
And i have money. 
That's really all it is. 
It really is. 
My mom works really hard. 
She was a single mom. 
She'd come home all 
Bent over after 15 hours. 
I'd be like, "mommy, 
Nyah nyah nyah." 
"Shut up!" 
I totally get that. 
I work two hours a week 
Sometimes, 
So it's not really fair, 
And i know that. 
I know there's moments 
When you just fucking-- 
I mean, they're-- 
Being a parent means you have 
Your back up against the wall 
All the time, 
Because it's the only job 
You can't quit. 
It's the only job 
Where you can't just go-- 
Just put your wrench 
Page 49/70
Down and go, 
"Fuck it, guys. 
I'm leaving. 
"I don't even 
Want my last check. 
I'm going home." 
Anyway, i got two. 
And the seven-year-old, 
She's no trouble now. 
That kid's amazing. 
She's better than me. 
She's smarter than me. 
She's more decent. 
She's cleaner. 
Like, she comes out 
of her room all dressed 
With a little bow. 
She's like, "hi. 
Good morning, daddy." 
And i'm in my underwear, 
Like, "uh, hi." 
I keep trying 
Not to screw her up, 
Because she's headed 
For a great life 
Unless i fuck it up. 
That's basically 
What's going on. 
I'm not--i'm not 
A father anymore. 
I'm just a fat landlord. 
I don't really matter. 
Like, the other day, she was 
Asking me all these questions. And i totally hear-- 
She's asking me stuff, 
And i'm just trying to tell her What i know to be the truth. 
But you can't just do that. 
There's some shit 
That's true 
That you can't tell your kids 
When they're certain ages. 
I know that sounds simple, 
Page 50/70
But you don't know all the time Until you fuck up. 
I'm talking to her, 
And she goes, 
"Daddy, does the earth 
Go around the sun?" 
And i was like, "yeah." 
She goes, "does it do it 
All the time?" 
And i go, "yeah." 
She says, "will the earth always Go around the sun forever?" 
And i was like, 
"Well, no, at some point, 
The sun's gonna explode." 
She's seven years old. 
Do you understand 
How horrible that is? 
She started crying 
Immediately. 
Crying bitter tears 
For the death of all humanity. And here's how 
I tried to save it. 
I go, "oh, honey, 
This isn't gonna happen 
"Until you 
And everybody you know 
Has been dead 
For a very long time." 
She didn't know 
Any of those things, 
And now she knows 
All of those things. 
She's gonna die. 
Everybody she knows 
Is gonna die. 
They're gonna be dead 
For a very long time, 
And then the sun's 
gonna explode. 
She learned all that 
In 12 seconds 
At the age of seven. 
Page 51/70
She took it pretty well. 
I was proud of her. 
She's like, "oh. Dude." 
[Breathes heavily] 
"Okay, well... 
I guess i'll go play. 
I don't..." 
She's had a tough year, 
That kid. 
I feel really bad. 
Lot of bad things 
Happened to her this year. 
This summer, 
She got bit by a pony. 
I'm not kidding. 
A pony bit her. 
How do you more break 
A little girl's heart? 
Than a pony bi-- 
That's like being raped 
By Santa Claus. 
It was the worst thing 
That ever happened, 
And it was made worse 
By the fact 
That it followed the greatest 
Moment of her life, 
Because she'd never 
Seen a pony up close. 
We just never were fucking-- 
Shitty parents. 
We never gave her, 
Like, a pony ride. 
And last summer 
I took the kids to Italy. 
I took my girls to Italy 
For whatever reason. 
I don't know why. 
And we're in this farmhouse 
In the middle of nowhere. 
And i put 'em to bed, 
And i come outside, 
And there's ponies. 
They just showed up 
Page 52/70
Out of nowhere. 
Just wild ponies. 
Like 50 ponies. 
I'm not fucking with you. 
A huge amount of ponies. 
And one donkey. 
I don't know why. 
There was one donkey 
Hanging out with the ponies. 
And they're just la-- 
And i'm like-- 
[Gasps] 
And i run downstairs, 
And i wake her up. 
The little one, fuck her. 
She's not making memories. 
Who cares? 
It's not worth it. 
I take the seven-year-old, 
And i bring her outside, 
And she's standing barefoot 
In her pajamas. 
And it's dusk, 
And it's ponies, 
And she's like-- 
[Gasps] 
And i'm like, 
"I'm the best fucking father. 
"I'm the best father. 
Yeah! 
"Yeah! 
Look at that shit! 
That's right! 
I gave that to you!" 
And she starts walking out 
Towards the ponies. 
She's like, 
"Can i go near them? 
I'm like, "yeah." 
I'm an idiot. 
I'm like, "yeah, totally. 
"Go on out there, honey. 
"You're only outnumbered 
"What could possibly happen 
Page 53/70
In a sea of wild ponies?" 
And she walks out, 
And there's this one, 
Beautiful, speckled pony, 
And as she's 
Walking towards it, 
I'm an asshole, 
'Cause i don't read-- 
It's going like-- 
[Snorts] 
It's totally going, 
"Dude, [snorts] no. 
"Not--i'm not one of-- 
Fuck it. 
"Get her out. Get her out. 
"I'm a--dude, 
I'm a fucking Italian wild pony. Get her out of here." 
Can i go, daddy? 
I'm like, "yes, totally. 
Go up to the pony." 
She walks up to the pony, 
And she turns to me and says, 
"He's beautiful." 
And as she's saying that, 
The pony bites her 
On the fucking leg. 
And she screams. 
It didn't break the skin, 
But it was an awful bruise. 
And i grab her 
And i run inside. 
And she says, "why, daddy? 
Why did the pony bite me?" 
And i said, "i don't know." 
And she said, 
"Do ponies bite a lot?" 
And i'm like, "well, yeah," 
'Cause i don't want her to think That she's so horrible 
That the first pony ever 
Bit her. 
I go, "yeah, honey, 
Ponies bite," 
Page 54/70
And she goes, "well, 
Why did you let me near it?" 
She's like, "dude, 
Make a fucking effort." 
And then we're in the house, 
And she says-- 
This is how great this kid is. She calms down, 
And she goes, 
"I want to look up 
About ponies biting." 
Like, that's how she thinks. 
Something upsets her, 
She wants to look it up 
And learn about it. 
She says, "i want to find out 
Why they bite 
And what people say about it." So we go and we do look up 
About ponies, 
And it turns 
Out they're assholes. 
They bite all the time. 
And there's all these websites That talk about what to do 
When your pony bites, 
And it's like everything else 
On the internet. 
It's just fighting. 
Just people angry at each other. The first guy says, 
"You got to punch the pony 
Right in the face." 
Just punch it 
Right in the face. 
Then the next person says, 
"You're a terrible person. 
You should have your ponies 
Taken away from you." 
The next person 
Was my favorite. 
They go, "people who don't punch Their ponies make me sick." 
So we really are 
Page 55/70
A divided nation. 
The three-year-old 
Is a different story. 
The three-year-old, 
Here's her deal. 
She's a three-year-old. 
That's really it. 
She's three years old. 
The other day 
I got in a fight with her. 
Whose fault is that? 
I'm 41, 
And she's 3. 
It's always your fault 
With a three-year-old. 
Always. 
Because they are 
Just what they are. 
They can't help it. 
Just tape the windows. 
It's a fucking hurricane. 
Just wait. 
Anytime you're like this 
With a three-year-old-- 
"Don't you under--" 
You're an idiot. 
That's you being an idiot. 
"Don't you understand?" 
"No, i don't, dad. 
I haven't developed enough. 
You just have to wait." 
But it was partly her fault, 
'Cause she wore me down. 
Let me tell you 
What happened. 
It was this horrible, 
Horrible day. 
It started the night before, 
'Cause she woke me up all night. Just woke me up 
Every fucking-- 
Just ten minutes. 
Just woke me up-- 
Just-- 
Page 56/70
"Dad." 
With nothing. 
That's the worst part. 
"Daddy!" 
"Wha--what? What is it?" 
"Um..." 
"Oh, fuck you. 
You got nothing. 
You bullshitter, you." 
So now it's the next morning, 
I'm making breakfast, 
And i'm gone. 
I'm insane. 
I drank too much coffee 
To overcompensate, 
And i'm like-- 
I keep having these moments 
Where it's like-- 
And there's nothing there. 
Just nothing. 
"Uh, okay. Jesus." 
I'm making french toast. 
She's over there 
Sitting in her little chair, 
Just fucking anger. 
Just pure--she's 
A little ball of anger. 
She's like, 
"I want french toast!" 
I'm like, "yeah, that's 
What i'm making, honey. 
I'm making french toast." 
I bring it over. 
"Here." 
"Give me syrup!" 
"Yes. of course. 
I'll give you syrup. 
I always do. 
I love you very much." 
"Cut it for me!" 
"I'm happy to cut it for you. 
"You're not asking nicely, 
But it's okay. 
"I'll cut it for you, 
Page 57/70
Baby. 
I love you very much." 
Then she's looking 
At her plate, 
And she's literally going-- 
[Breathing heavily] 
'Cause she needs to be-- 
Want something. 
You know, she didn't-- 
There's nothing logical 
For her to want, 
So her brain has to go 
Somewhere crazy. 
So she's looking 
At her plate. 
She goes, "i don't know 
Which piece to eat!" 
And i'm still not engaging. 
I'm like, 
"Oh, i know, honey. 
"That's hard. 
That's really hard. 
"I'll just make a list of pros And cons for every piece, 
And i'll help you 
With it later." 
And i look at her, 
And she's walking towards me now With the plate just vertical, 
With syrup fucking 
Going on the floor. 
She's like, 
"Help me! 
You're not helping!" 
And i'm standing there, 
Like, looking at her, 
And i love her, 
And i'm proud of her in a way, 'Cause i know she'll never 
Want for anything. 
She'll beat the shit 
Out of people. 
She's... 
She'll kill people for meat 
Page 58/70
After the apocalypse. 
She'll be one of those. 
And then later i'm trying 
To get them dressed for school, And now the clock's ticking, 
And i'm like, "uh..." 
And i'm trying to put 
A sweater on her, 
And it's impossible. 
The sweater has buttons 
That just don't exist. 
And i'm fucking-- 
My fat fingers, 
And they're full of sweat. 
And i have just tears 
Going down my cheeks. 
Crazy tears. 
I'm not crying. 
I'm, like, 
Smiling with tears. 
Copious-- 
"I can't-- 
I can't put on the sweater. 
"I can't put on the sweater. 
I can't. 
I really can't do it." 
And she's going like this. 
So i give her a fig newton 
Just to immobilize her, 
Just to stop it. 
'Cause she loves fig newtons. 
I go, "here, honey. 
Have a fig newton." 
She goes, "they're not 
Called fig newtons. 
They're called pig newtons." 
And i go, 
"No, they're not. 
They're called fig newtons." 
And right away in my head 
I'm like, "what are you doing? "Why? 
What is to be gained? 
What do you care?" 
Page 59/70
Just--"yeah, pig newtons. 
Fine. Go ahead. 
"Good luck to you. 
Go through life. 
"See what kind of job 
You can hold down 
"With shit like that 
Clanging around in your head. 
I don't care. 
I'll be dead." 
But for some reason 
I engaged. 
"No, honey, 
They're called fig newtons." 
She goes, 
"No. You don't know. 
You don't know. 
They're called pig newtons." 
And i just--i feel this rage 
Building inside. 
Just... 
Because it's not 
That she's wrong. 
She's three. 
She's entitled to be wrong. 
But it's the fucking arrogance of this kid. 
No humility. 
No decent sense 
of self-doubt. 
She's not going like, "dad, 
I think those are pig newtons. Are you sure 
That you have it right?" 
She's not saying that. 
She's not going, like, 
"Dad, i'm pretty sure 
Those are pig newtons," 
Which would be a little 
Cunty, but acceptable. 
I could deal with that. 
She's giving me nothing. 
"No, you don't know. 
Those are pig--" 
Page 60/70
I'm like, 
"Really? I don't know? 
"I don't know? 
"Dude, i'm not even using 
My memory right now, okay? 
"I'm reading the fucking box 
"That the shit came out of! 
"It says it! 
Where are you getting 
Your information?" 
"How do you fuck with me 
On this? 
"You're 3 and i'm 41! 
"What are the odds that 
You're right and i'm wrong? 
"What are the sheer odds 
of that? 
"And take a bite 
of the cookie. 
"Does it taste like 
A pork cookie, motherfucker? 
"I don't think so. 
Why would they call it 
A pig newton?" 
"What's-- 
Oh, it tastes like figs. 
Fucking interesting, 
That, isn't it?" 
I didn't say a word of that. 
Obviously. 
But anyway, later... 
Got the kids dressed. 
It's winter. 
We all have the layers on, 
And it's time 
To go to school. 
And i've got ten minutes 
To get to a school 
That's ten minutes away, 
Which is a horrible feeling. 
I put my hand 
On the door to leave, 
And all of a sudden i go, 
"I got to take a shit. 
Page 61/70
"Take the coats off, kids. 
"We're gonna be late. 
"You're gonna be 
I don't give a shit." 
I am not walking 
To school like this. 
I can't use the bathroom 
At the school, 
'Cause child molesters 
Ruined that for everybody. 
Just--we're-- 
I'm shitting here. 
So i'm sitting on the toilet. 
I'm shitting. 
With the door open, 
By the way. 
That's my life. 
Two kids by myself. 
I can't shit 
With the door closed. 
Unless i gather them 
Into the bathroom 
To watch daddy take a dump. 
Which i've done 
With the little one. 
"Honey, uh, i got to poop 
And you're too crazy. 
Just come with me. 
You got to come with me." 
So i'm sitting there, 
And i'm shitting, 
And i'm trying to see them 
In the other room. 
"Honey, 
Stay between the tables. 
I can't see you," 
I said. 
The little one 
Walks into view naked. 
It's all gone. 
All gone. 
Walks up, looks at me. 
And then she-- 
I don't know why, 
Page 62/70
But she shows me her ass. 
It's something 
She always does when she's-- 
She just goes-- 
"Look at it! 
Daddy, 
You're not looking!" 
So i'm sitting there shitting, Looking at her ass. 
[Clears throat] 
And i saw something 
That i'd never seen before. 
And i'm gonna describe it to you The way that i saw it, 
Because it just--i didn't know What i was looking at. 
I'm looking at her little, 
White ass. 
She's white. Little, perfect, 
Little, white ass. 
And right in the center of it, This little black dot 
Just--boop! 
Appeared like magic. 
That's what it 
Looked like to me, 
Because i've never 
Seen shit 
Actually coming out 
of an ass before. 
I never saw that. 
I never saw the shit-- 
Like, the crowning, 
The shit coming out. 
And if you ever do see that, 
It's fucking bananas, man. 
It's weird. 
And upsetting. 
I yelled. 
I went, "aah!" 
And a second later, just-- 
She just drops 
This massive-- 
I felt the impact tremor 
Page 63/70
Under my feet. 
This huge pile of shit. 
Just a pile. 
Like several people's 
Pile of shit. 
Like a port-a-potty on 
The last day of the festival. 
Just a huge, 
Huge pile of shit. 
How? She's three. 
This kid shits like a bear. 
I don't understand it. 
Seriously. 
If you were in the woods 
And you saw a shit like that, 
You'd be like, "let's get 
The fuck out of here! 
Run!" 
Huge pile of shit. 
As big as her whole body. 
Easily. 
I thought she would just crumple Like a balloon on top of it. 
"Huh. Weird." 
She's standing there just 
Straddling this huge shit, 
Presenting it, like... 
She slips, falls 
Right into her own shit. 
Yes, fell-- 
I was there. 
Fell right in the middle 
of her own heap of shit. 
Her head hit the floor. 
You know that sound of your 
Kid's head hitting the floor? 
[Smacks stool] 
"Ooh. Oh, God. 
"Uh, she's done. 
"That's it for her. 
She's finished. 
"She's gonna be running 
To the mailbox once a day. 
That's about it for her." 
Page 64/70
Now she's laying 
In her shit, 
Screaming and crying 
And making an angel. 
I run over. 
I'm still shitting, 
Holding a 
Shit-covered child. 
We're the shit family. 
That's what we are. 
The seven-year-old's 
Standing there, 
"I got to get 
The fuck out of here. 
This is horrible." 
That's my life right now, 
Man. 
That's--like, where in there 
Do i fit, like, 
Getting pussy? 
Like, there's no place 
For that. 
I can't even think about it. 
I tried to, like-- 
The other day i was, like, 
Okay, take a sexual 
Inventory here. 
What do you got left, 
You know? 
And i went-- 
I took off my clothes, 
And i stood in the mirror, 
And i looked in the mirror, 
Like, a full-length mirror, 
Naked. 
I'll never do that again. 
I don't need-- 
I don't need to do it. 
I can go my whole life 
Without doing it again. 
I'm going to. 
I'm not in good shape. 
I'm not in the worst shape. 
I mean, 
Page 65/70
I went to a doctor, 
And he gave me the whole 
He's like, "all right, well, 
Your cholesterol is high, 
"But i don't expect you 
To do anything about that. 
"And your prostate's 
A little bit too big. 
"Let's go ahead and let it 
Be a little too big. 
And you're only 
Cosmetically overweight." 
I was like, "what?" 
He goes, 
"Your overweightness, 
It's not a medical issue." 
I'm like, "well, so then you 
didn't have to say anything. 
Why--why did you even 
bring it up?" 
You're just saying, like, 
"Well, medically speaking, 
You don't have a weight 
problem, but you look gross." 
That's what he's saying. 
I'm looking at myself, 
And here's the problem, 
Is that i didn't even 
wear down evenly. 
Like, different parts 
of my body 
Are older than others. 
Like, my dick and balls 
Don't even match each other. 
Like, my balls 
Are older than me. 
They're, like, the old-- 
I swear to God. 
I'm 41. 
My balls are, like, 72. 
They're really old, and they 
Just kind of hang there. 
They're just hanging, like... 
They look like they're being 
Page 66/70
Rescued by a helicopter 
From a mountain. 
[Imitates helicopter] 
They've been trapped 
On a mountain together. 
Zipped together 
In a sleeping bag. 
[Shuddering] 
"If we ever get out of this, 
I'll never call you lefty again. I'm sorry." 
And then my dick is, like, 
Happy and shiny 
And young-looking. 
My penis is, like, a young, 
Walking down with these 
Two old guys following him. 
Hey, man, hang back. 
I'm trying to get some pussy. 
Get out of here. 
[Elderly voice] 
"Wait for us." 
And at some point, 
I got to show this shit 
To some poor, 
Unfortunate woman 
That has to see this 
Fucked up package of mine. 
I don't know what-- 
Like, i'll tuck my balls 
Between my legs. 
"I don't have balls. 
I just have a penis. 
Is that okay?" 
That must be weird for women, 
That you don't know what kind of Dick and balls you're gonna get Until it's way too late. 
Like, it's the last 
Thing you see. 
And it doesn't seem fair. 
It should be the first 
Thing you see. 
Every date should start 
Page 67/70
With a guy taking out-- 
"Is this gonna be okay?" 
"Yeah, that's fine. 
It's gonna be worth my time. 
Go ahead and put it away. 
We'll deal with it later." 
'Cause you don't-- 
You don't find out till you're Looking down the barrel of it, And it's really too late now. 
Like, "oh, Jesus." 
And the dick's 
Looking up at you, 
And it's all... 
Like, "this is, 
Like, a Dr. Seuss tree. 
"I don't even-- 
It's all yellowy brown 
With sprigs coming out." 
And women are so nice. 
I don't know a single story 
of a woman who finally gets 
A guy's dick out and goes, 
"No. That--no. 
"That's not your dick. 
Come on! 
"Take out your penis. 
"That's not a penis. 
That's bullshit." 
They just go, "okay. 
Oh, fuck. 
What hole can i put this in 
That'll depress me the least?" And i have-- 
I have met some women 
Since i been single, 
And they've been younger, 
Mostly, 
Because women my age-- 
I like women my age, 
But they're mostly either 
Married with children 
Or in a room alone, 
Angry and crazy. 

One or the other. 
They're not out looking 
To fuck a comic, generally. 
But young women 
Are up for something. 
They'll fuck you and do 
Other things later. 
Like... 
And also, 
With younger women, 
I'm in competition 
With younger guys, 
And younger guys 
Are not very subtle. 
They don't really know 
How to talk to a woman 
Even their own age. 
They're just kind of all-- 
Like, penis skin's been grafted On their whole body. 
They're just-- 
[Mutters] 
"Can i--is this... 
"Is this is a fuck date? 
'Cause i... 
I just want to put my come 
In your body." 
It's just a lot of pressure. 
And then the young woman 
Meets me, 
And i'm like, "hey, look, 
"I've been jerking off in 
The guest room for 15 years. 
"I'm like the man 
In the iron mask. 
I'm just happy to be out." 
Young guys are-- 
They're afraid of women. 
They're afraid 
of their feelings. 
"My girlfriend's mad at me!" 
Well, later she won't be. 
Fucking calm down. 
They're afraid 

of their bodies. 
They're afraid 
of women's bodies. 
"My girlfriend's having 
Her period. What do i do?" 
Fuck her in the period hole, 
You idiot. 
What is--what's the dilemma? 
I don't give a shit. 
If you're having your period, 
Come on over. 
I'm 41. I'm--i'll fuck 
The shit out of you. 
I'll drink the blood. 
Let's party. 
Thank you very much, guys. 
You guys--you were great. 
Thank you.
