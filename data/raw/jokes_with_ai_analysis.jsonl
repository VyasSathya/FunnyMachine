And this is important because someday one of your friends is  gonna get divorced. It's gonna happen and they're gonna tell you don't go  aww sorry. That's a stupid thing to say. It really is. First of all you're  making them feel bad for being really happy which isn't fair. Let me explain  something. Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird but it's true  because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It's really that simple.  That's never happened. That would be sad if two people were married and  they were really happy and they just had a great thing and then they  divorced. That would be really sad. But that has happened zero times. Literally  zero. Ray Charles has killed more Jews than happy marriages have ended in  divorce. So if your friend got divorced it means things were bad and  now they're I mean they're better. They're not good. Life is shit wall  to wall but they're better so you should be happy. But the part that's  being single at 41 after 10 years of marriage and two kids it's that's like  having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn't exist  anymore.

I thought I was gonna  be shoving it into the same person every three months till one of us  died. What I thought was the nature of the deployment for this. I didn't  think I had to be like appealing to someone from scratch. It's like  having a 73 Dodge Dart in your backyard and it's been sitting back  there with grass growing. You don't have any it's not an old Mustang. You have  no plans to restore that dart. You don't even see it when you look out  the window and now you find out that's your only way to work. You need  that car now. You're like oh shit it's got bees in it. I didn't take  living in the tailpipe. I can't take that to work. I have no single instincts. I  know too much to be single.

racist Chinese lady might have been thinking it she  possible and I went to England I spent a month there I liked England  everything's different I mean that's that's obvious but some of the  differences were cool I like the money the money instead of a dollar bill  they have the pound coin and it's a coin and you throw it on the counter  it felt kind of cool like the Old West like going to you know being on  the dusty trail you see a saloon so you walk over with your horse you  throw the rope vaguely at the pole outside thing they do well it's my whole  life on that horse should be fine walk in a saloon give me a beer bottle of  whiskey in a room for a week can steak dinner shave and a haircut the  bath some new clothes and a hat and some boots some oats from a horse and  woman here you go that's all one heavy coin you're fine nobody adds up all  those things you mentioned they don't check to see what coin it was the guy  just keeps drying the glass things were very vague back then things just  cost money hey how much is that money in the old English movies it was  different it was a little sack of coins remember that a little draw  string sack tossed over by some faggy lord with a ruffle shirt throw it  disdainfully down to some commoner who's gonna do some beneath his station  follow the girl and report back to me at midnight bring a shovel and a sack  and two reliable men such as yourself what's that oh yes of course well  this ought to be sufficient thank you sir so happy to get a general  amount of some kind of currency or another you didn't like
