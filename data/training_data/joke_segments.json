It's gonna happen and they're gonna tell you don't go  aww sorry. That's a stupid thing to say. It really is. First of all you're  making them feel bad for being really happy which isn't fair. Let me explain  something. Divorce is always good news. I know that sounds weird but it's true  because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce. It's really that simple.  That's never happened. That would be sad if two people were married and  they were really happy and they just had a great thing and then they  divorced. That would be really sad. But that has happened zero times. Literally  zero. Ray Charles has killed more Jews than happy marriages have ended in  divorce. So if your friend got divorced it means things were bad and  now they're I mean they're better. They're not good. Life is shit wall  to wall but they're better so you should be happy. But the part that's  being single at 41 after 10 years of marriage and two kids it's that's like  having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn't exist  anymore. Like like I found 500 million Prussian francs. I can't really take  advantage of being single because I didn't I didn't expect to be single.  I'm not prepared. I didn't think I'd ever be I didn't keep this shit up.  You understand? I didn't maintain any of this at presentation condition. It's  function only. It was not think I would need it that way. I thought I was gonna  be shoving it into the same person every three months till one of us  died. What I thought was the nature of the deployment for this. I didn't  think I had to be like appealing to someone from scratch. It's like  having a 73 Dodge Dart in your backyard and it's been sitting back  there with grass growing. You don't have any it's not an old Mustang. You have  no plans to restore that dart. You don't even see it when you look out  the window and now you find out that's your only way to work. You need  that car now. You're like oh shit it's got bees in it. I didn't take  living in the tailpipe. I can't take that to work. I have no single instincts. I  know too much to be single. I know everything that happens now. That's no  good for single. You got to be optimistic to be single. Stupid. You  have to be stupid. That's what optimistic means you know. It means  stupid. An optimist somebody goes hey maybe something nice will happen. Why  the fuck would anything nice ever happen? What are you stupid? But that's the  attitude you have to be to be single. You have to look at something and go  ooh maybe. Look at it that way. Even when I see something I'm attracted to. I was at a gym  the other day. Why? Why? I'm at a gym. I'm just I'm just wearing shorts. That's  all I'm doing there. Just standing there. And I look over and there's a  girl on the you know with a ponytail and she's on this thing and I'm  looking at her and I'm like she's awesome. But then I start thinking  wait I'm single. I'm on the market. I have value. I could say something to  her. I could just walk up and say something and I'm trying to think what  am I gonna say? What do I look like to somebody like that?

beer bottle of  whiskey in a room for a week can steak dinner shave and a haircut the  bath some new clothes and a hat and some boots some oats from a horse and  woman here you go that's all one heavy coin you're fine nobody adds up all  those things you mentioned they don't check to see what coin it was the guy  just keeps drying the glass things were very vague back then things just  cost money hey how much is that money in the old English movies it was  different it was a little sack of coins remember that a little draw  string sack tossed over by some faggy lord with a ruffle shirt throw it  disdainfully down to some commoner who's gonna do some beneath his station  follow the girl and report back to me at midnight bring a shovel and a sack  and two reliable men such as yourself

enough for the shovel is not enough there that was a  good time in our economy when you needed to have gold to buy shit we  might be going back to that pretty soon too things are pretty fucked up
