Now I'm like, what, why would I do that?  That's not gonna happen.  That's not gonna happen.  as far as the shape I'm in,  I just want it to be so that if you find out  That's all.  That's all.  I want you to wonder what happened.  I don't, to be like, oh, he died?  Sure he did.  Shit, oh, really?  Oh my God.  Something's changed when you get older.  Like I've reallocated some of the noises that I make.  Like the noise I used to make when I come  is now the noise I make when I pee.  Very disrespectful to my toilet, unfortunately.  Yeah, you like that piss, don't you, bitch?  I'm gonna shit in your mouth too,  You sit there waiting for me to shit in your face.  Got piss on your lips.  You ain't even special.  You ain't shit.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  But that's how my dad treated his toilets,  so that's where I learned it.  It's a shame.  So that's the noise I make when I pee.  And some of you might be wondering,  none of you are wondering,  what noise do I make when I come?  So this is the noise I make when I come.  I just go.  It is done.  The thing with clouds and lightning and crows.  Ah!  Ah!  The circle is complete.  It's intense.",

        "bit_text": " It's been an interesting time, you know?  Cause you can be on an airplane.  You're like one of 200 passengers.  You're on a flight, 30,000 feet in the air  in the middle of the flight.  If you just decide to do this,  you're sitting in your seat  and you just start going like this.  You go, mwah.  they will land the plane.  You can will a plane to the ground  without a weapon or a threat.  You can just sit there and just start going down.  Down, down.  Down, down.  Sir, is there a problem?  Down, down.  I mean, you're going to the nearest airport.  They'd like bother you.  What'd you do?  Why'd you do it?  I just didn't want to be up anymore.  Just didn't like it.  where I wanted to be.  You didn't have to do it.  Just a suggestion.  Jesus Christ.  I was on a plane once  and there was two babies on a plane  and other people.  Wasn't just, wasn't just me and two babies.  That would be weird.  You get on a plane, there's just two babies.  Come on, we're leaving soon.  He's the pilot baby.  I'm the other baby.  No, that's all right.  I'm not going to,  you babies have a good flight,  but I'm going to find another way to get there.  Yeah, I don't like the way this was starting.  Anyway, I was on a plane  and there was these two babies  and they're crying the whole time.  Crying the whole flight and that happens a lot.  I don't think they knew each other.  They're just crying.  I've seen this on so many flights.  I started to wonder, is there a reason for this?  so I looked it up.  Turns out there's an actual reason  why babies cry on airplanes  and it's because they're upset  that gay people are getting married.  Like really upset.  Like inconsolably upset.  Honey, it's the country's changing.  And I don't agree with them.  I think if people are in love,  they should get married,  because they're just, you know, just being babies.  Babies are selfish.  They are, babies are selfish.  They just, meh.  No baby ever goes, meh,  but how are you doing though?  I have two daughters  and both of them at one time were babies  and I held them and they cried on planes.  It's happened to me.  I've had a baby on a plane.  If you're ever, this is how selfish people are.  When you're on a plane and you hear a baby crying,  you think that's happening to you.  which means they've been traveling with a baby all day,  So their life isn't even good.  I remember one time my baby was crying on the plane.  She was really upset.  And this guy and some businessman on the plane,  because businessmen always think  that every flight is a private plane of theirs  that we're all piggybacking on.  And this guy has this fucking newspaper  He doesn't kind of go like this.  He looks at me like, hmm?  Like, could ya?  You applauded a dead baby.",

That's what it is.  I miss you people.  and I get to go, fuck that one, and that was okay.  I'm just looking at the top of people's heads now.  I have a younger friend who vapes  She's like, I barely feel it.  Sometimes it helps me sleep.  So one night we're hanging out  and I'm like, I'm gonna go home and go to sleep.  I mean, let's try it.  So I took one little tiny hit.  I'm so high.  And I texted another friend, I'm so high.  That's what I wrote.  I'm not bragging.  And then later I looked at my text and I was like,  I think I might've sent that to my 12 year old daughter.  that turn them at the same moment.  And there's a warning.  Huh!  Huh!

My grandfather told me.  I wasn't even talking to him.  I was just trying to blow out the candles.  And I was seven years old  And I was seven years old  when I found out that everybody dies.  but because I knew it.  I was excited because I knew I was young  to know that everybody dies.  I knew that most of my friends didn't know,  and I thought, I wanna tell them.  I especially wanted to tell Benji,  this kid across the street from me.  This is kid Benji.  I didn't, he wasn't my friend.  but if I ever came out in my front yard,  he'd come out and I'd be like, oh, here he comes.  Just hated him.  Like, visceral hate.  To me, he was a piece of shit cocksucker asshole.  And I didn't even know any of those words.  I just had that, like, as a raw feeling  I was too young for the feeling that I had.  And then somebody, I heard somebody say,  piece of shit cocksucker asshole.  I was like, dad, yes, thank you.  That's what, dad, yes.  That's how, yes.  Anyway, one day I was in my front yard  and piece of shit Benji comes across  or something like that.  And I was like, you're gonna die someday.  He was like, what?  No, I'm not.  I said, yes, you are.  I said, yes, you are.  Everybody dies.  You're gonna die, and your mom's gonna die,  and your daddy's gonna die in that order.  It's still funny to me.  Wonder if he's dead.  Wonder if he's dead.  His mom's so angry.  And then I was scared.  And his mom came over, what did you say to him?  And I said, I told him that everybody dies.  He's like, what?  but not everybody does.  I was like, what about Abraham Lincoln  and George Washington?  They're dead.  Well, she said, yeah,  that's because something happened to them.  George Washington didn't take care of himself  and Lincoln got shot.  But there's a lot of people alive from those days.  And then I went to my mom.  I told the whole thing.  She was like, don't worry, that lady's a fucking idiot.  Don't listen to her.  Don't listen to her.  My mom said, don't worry, baby.  You're definitely going to die.  I wonder if people in the Bible knew  they were gonna be in the Bible.  I'm gonna get my roots done  so I look good for the Bible.  Yeah, my dog died recently.

I got to, I can't just, she'll get,  So I go downstairs.  I'm terrified.  for like an hour.  even if there is a witch in there,  she wouldn't just make a noise  So I go in, there's nobody in the kitchen.  And it was the dishwasher.  The dishwasher has weird tubes.  And when the soap goes through them,  it's kind of vocal.  I don't know why, but it goes,  I was like, all right, it's cool.  I'm fine.  There's no witches.  picked that and he's like,  I don't know if you ever called 911  I don't know if you ever called 911  and you don't realize until they answer  911, tell us your emergency.

You ran over your head.  Felt like she was doing a lot of work  I don't wanna say it.  So I call the batman and he comes over  And so finally there's a knock at my door  and he's like, hello.  And he says, where's the bat?  That's it.  That's it.  He's like, all right.  Like, yeah, you pretty much nailed it.  Thank goodness.  What a relief to have a man in the house.  Wasn't expecting company.  Oh, my robe fell open.  He saw my bra.  What do we do now, Mr. Batman?  You know, I'm kind of grateful to that bat now.  Now that you're going to fuck me.  You're not?  Right, you can go then.  I can't get out of it.  I'm sorry.  I just like to keep doing that till the laughter stops.  Fuck, he's really,  What if I just did that for like 40 minutes?
