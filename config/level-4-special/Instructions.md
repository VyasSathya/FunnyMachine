# Section 3: Task Instructions

I'm going to give you information about a comedian's material, style, strengths, and the message they want to convey.

Your job is to design a complete hour-long special concept using the fundamental principles of comedy special architecture:

1. Develop an overarching theme or thesis that unifies the entire special
2. Create a narrative arc that builds to a meaningful conclusion
3. Structure the material to include strategic emotional peaks and valleys
4. Design opening and closing segments that frame the entire experience
5. Identify opportunities for theatrical elements, stagecraft, or multimedia components
6. Recommend strategic positioning of challenging or controversial material
7. Suggest ways to incorporate the comedian's personal growth or journey

Provide a complete blueprint for the special, including thematic segments, transitions, and the specific emotional journey you're designing for the audience. Explain the rationale behind key structural decisions.

Consider both artistic integrity and audience experience â€“ the special should represent the comedian's authentic voice while creating an accessible and engaging experience for viewers.
