# Section 3: Task Instructions

I'm going to give you a collection of bits, premises, or raw comedic ideas that need to be structured into a cohesive set.

Your job is to analyze and organize this material into a flowing performance using the core principles of set architecture:

1. Identify thematic connections between seemingly disparate bits
2. Create a logical progression that builds momentum and audience trust
3. Design natural transitions that maintain energy and flow
4. Engineer strategic callbacks and running themes
5. Structure the material to create an emotional journey with peaks and valleys
6. Develop a strong opening and memorable closing that frame the entire experience

Show multiple potential set structures with explanations of why each arrangement works differently. Consider how different opening bits establish different expectations and alter the reception of later material.

Focus on creating the most impactful experience rather than trying to use every piece of material provided. Sometimes the strongest set comes from strategic omission.
