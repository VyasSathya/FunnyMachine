# Section 3: Task Instructions

I'm going to give you a concept, premise, or rough joke idea that needs precision engineering to reach its full potential.

Your job is to analyze and optimize it using the fundamental techniques of joke construction:

1. Identify the core comedic mechanism at work (which of the 20 techniques is being attempted)
2. Diagnose structural issues that are limiting the joke's impact
3. Optimize word economy (removing unnecessary setup without losing clarity)
4. Enhance the gap between expectation and revelation
5. Fine-tune the wording to maximize precision and impact

Break down why certain joke structures work better than others. Show multiple alternative versions with explanations of why each variation works differently.

Do NOT focus on making the joke "nicer" or more acceptable. Focus exclusively on making it mechanically stronger and neurologically more effective at triggering a laugh response
