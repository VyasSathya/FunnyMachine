But, oh, a lot of stability out there.  A lot of stable people.  And all couples married people could pay that to me.  I travel around like a circus freak.  Never married, no kids.  They date girls half my age.  You end up faced to yourself with a mirror.  Like, what are you?  Some kind of a genius.  How am I pulling this off?  I'm 87.  I don't have money to raise a kid.

I'm going to be rich.  All right, I got to get out of here.  Everybody thanks so much.  Come on, let's get this party rocking.  What a crowd.  What a night.  Dolby theater.  Hollywood.  Are you ready?  What are you ready for the review?  Please welcome Louis C.K.  Come on.  Thank you.  And hello there.  Okay.  All right, we're going to talk to you for about an hour  and it's weird.  It's weird what I do.  Somebody asked me once if it takes confidence.  Nobody asked me, but I just want to talk about this.  If it takes, it does take confidence to do this.  It takes not a general confidence, but it's a specific kind.  You know, there's lots of kinds of confidence.  There's personal confidence.  I don't have much of that.  Personal confidence is like a man wearing white pants.  That takes, you know?  Tremendous confidence.  And optimism, really.  To leave the house in white pants, like it's going to be a great day.  It's going to be no puddles or pizza, nothing.  I could never wear white pants because I'll get my period first of all.  I know that.  Or diarrhea more likely, which is, that's really my period.  diarrhea.  But once a month, I'm like, oh, fuck, here we go.  Better just get home.  Don't make any big decisions today.  It's true, don't make, you know, be a diarrhea.  It don't like negotiate.  It's a bad bargaining position.  Five diarrhea used in between me and the toilet.  I'll sell you my house for 10 cents.  So that's one kind of confidence.  Here's another kind of moral confidence.  Moral confidence.  That means knowing that you would do the right thing.  Knowing that you wouldn't do something wrong.  Moral confidence.  You can have that in your daily life, because a lot of your days are the same.  But what if you were in another time?  Like, I would love to believe.  I feel confident that I would not have had slaves.  I wouldn't have done it.  I wouldn't have done it.  I wouldn't have had any.  Even if I lived in 17 whatever in Virginia and all my neighbors had slaves,  I would have been like, you guys are dicks.  I can say that, but it's easy to say that now,  because you can't get no slaves.  You just can't get any.  That's why you don't have slaves.  It's not because you're better than back then people.  It's because they're not available.  That's a huge contributing factor.  It's not a decision you need to make every day like you're crying.  You're growing your groceries, but I'll fuck, maybe I should say.  I'm not going to not.  She said it would be easier.  Because it's not like they have slaves at home, deepo.  I mean, they kind of do.  There are some forms of kindness slavery.  You can get a Russian woman to do whatever you want, because their family's hostage.  That's one of them.  But that's still temporary.  I mean, you can adopt a 12-year-old from Bangladesh.  I mean, really, he'll move in your house and do your laundry,  and suck your dick, whatever you want, but even he gets to leave when he's 18.  Although, who wants them when they're that old?  I'm just saying, excuse me, I'm just saying,  that slavery gets rebranded, but it doesn't really ever totally go away.  I mean, it's been part of human history.  Going way back, way back, slavery.  Even the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, I don't know,  find it to go to college, I don't know anything.  But the earliest images of human life already had the guys going,  anything like that, I'm trying to learn.  How early did we come up with this?  Like, from the beginning of human existence, we evolved, you know, through ideas.  We were a scared naked ape, and then we were like, make a fire, it's a good idea.  Kill an animal and take his fur, it's a good idea.  Plant things and then wait, it's a good idea.  But really quickly, we came up with, just make them fucking do it, I'm not doing anything.  I'm doing nothing, make them fucking do it.  I was like, our third thing we did on earth.  So you can have confidence, but you gotta be a little, you know.  I mean, there's things that people didn't history that I wouldn't have done,  for sure, like I wouldn't have made an Auschwitz, I wouldn't have done that.  What am I going to do with an Auschwitz?  Yeah, Auschwitz is not one of those where you're like, it was the times, you know, it was,  it was a horrible thing, obviously, Auschwitz, horrible. They killed people, they killed children,  they killed little children and Auschwitz, who could have grown up and moved to Brooklyn  and hated black people, and they didn't get to do that.  It's terrible, I know.  I had a friend who's a comedian in England and he made a joke about Auschwitz,  and he got in a lot of trouble, there was a big shitstorm, and at one point Auschwitz tweeted  about his joke, it's true, it's an Auschwitz with a blue check.  So it was like, oh, cool, it's really them.  And they tweeted, like, that's not funny.  Why is the death camp tweeting?  Who's running the social accounts at Auschwitz?  I got a summer job at Auschwitz.  I'm running their Twitter.  The moral confidence is otherwise to boost your moral confidence, like you can do good things.  No, you're not. You can, you can help people all the time, you can help homeless people.  There's a lot of homeless people here. There's a shit little homeless people here. I mean,  not in here. There's none in here. There's zero in here.  That's right. They can't come in here. Even with a ticket, they can not come in here.  They're not allowed in the places where we're allowed.  That's what we all agree on.  That's everybody's like, I don't know what to do about the homeless, but they're not coming in here.  They're outdoor people. They don't have, if you don't have your own indoors, you can't go in other people's indoors.  They can't go where we go.  This place is where you'll never see a homeless person. Like the airport. There's no homeless people at the airport.  You go to the bus station. They're on the bus beside you.  But at the airport, they can't even get to it. They can't even get to it.  You know what's going on with the airport? You never been at your gate and some guys say,  hey man, try guys Tokyo, can you help me out?  Give me an I'll see you brother.  And they're all over the country, everywhere now. I've been on tour. I've seen them everywhere. I was in Phoenix  and it was during the summer, 120 degrees. And homeless people just standing at the intersection  with a sign and they're just, it's just cooking. You can't even tell what race he was before it burns off.  And he's holding a sign that says, help, I'm on fire.  But you're like, you're in a white BMW. I can't, I can't, sorry.  There's glass here. I can't help because of the glass.  And even here you drive by him. In New York, you walk right by him. So in New York, they're right there.  They're in your space. They're in your world. And you got to make a choice. Every couple of blocks.  You got to make a choice. You're going to help or not. You got to keep shooting. You got to put a  limon on it somewhere because you're not going to help all of them. And you're not going to help any of them. Really.  With a few bucks. But there's always that, like there's a homeless guy who lives,  I didn't, he doesn't live anywhere. But I mean he's by definition. He's at large.  But he's often seen. He's always on the corner by my house. Same guy every day. And I walk past  him every day. On the way to the store. I go to the same store every day. I go to  Clairs. I don't know if you know Clairs. So jewelry store for children. I go there every day.  I buy a handful of scrunchies and I run home. Everything else I buy online.  Anyway, when I walk by this homeless guy in the morning, he always goes, hey man,  can you help me out? And I go, sure, I give him five bucks. Then I go to the store. If I 'm going to say to her, walk by and he says, hey man, okay, here's a member. Which is fine. But I don't want  to give him another five bucks. You know? Because I only have a few million. I don't know why. I  I clearly shouldn't. I don't know what makes me go, mm-hmm. You had your five dollars  young man. What am I going to spoil him? You don't know what's thinking about today? I'm thinking about  Jesus. I was. Today, I was thinking about Jesus. And after I came, I thought, well, I feel sorry  for Jesus. That's how I feel. I don't know how much you know about Jesus, but I feel fucking bad for  Jesus, man. I do. He had a hard life. I mean, the last day was particularly difficult, but  if you look at pictures of him, he had to wear that, that phone, that fucking just dish rag, yanked up his  balls, just, uh, carrying his cross like fuck, the rash. Some people say you should live like Jesus. Who can  live? He was insane. I can't live like that. He had a weird life. I'm reading about Jesus. I have  this book about Jesus. I'm going to share with you. Okay. This is a book about Jesus. Actually, only this  much is about Jesus. Only that just that part. The rest of it is just the Jews going like, and then we  walked the 50 years and the deserts. And we only had a little bit of oil. It's just, it's fucking  verbose. The Julia, just Jews. It just goes on and on it. And then Jacob bought a goat and, uh,  and the Abraham lived to be 800. Yeah, I bet he fucking did too. The Jews in the early chapters are all like  800 years old. And then God was like, I can't with these fucking Jews for 800 years. Heart disease starts today.  So that's them. And that's Jesus. All those little parts, Jesus. And the weird part is it's not all,  like it's, it's all the same story over and over again. They tell the same story about Jesus, like over  first Matthew tells it. And then Mark is like, dude, that's not what fucking truth. Here's what  happened. I'll tell you what happened. Hey, Paul, you weren't even here. Shut the fuck up.  And I started reading it because I never read it. I was raised Catholic, but they don't encourage you to read  the church. They don't. They don't want you to read this. You know, Jews read this shit and Hebrew.  And Baptist sit down. They read together. But the Catholics, they want you to come in the building.  They want you to come in and they tell you. And you're like, can I read that? I'll tell you what happened. They're  you know, sorry, put the book down. But it's interesting because when you read the stories,  you know, you think of them as lofty kind of like, but some of them are just basic life in the Jesus.  Like, okay, here's one. This is when you turn a water into wine. This is his first miracle. This is  John chapter two, okay? Okay. And on the third day there was a wedding in Canna of Galilee. And the  mother of Jesus was there. And both Jesus was called and his disciples to the wedding. And when they  wanted wine, the mother of Jesus sayeth unto him, they have no wine here. And Jesus sayeth unto her,  woman, what have I to do with thee? Just life Mary was a fucking alcoholic. He took her to a wedding.  And there's no fucking wine, Jesus. What am I supposed to say? Here, here, here. Why?  And he's like, mom. Don't.  Anyway, you know the rest of the story is that Jesus, he's at the wedding. They had no wine. So Jesus  went to the guy running the wedding and he was like, look in the water barrel. Like that, like a close  magician, one should take a look. Maybe it's not the red queen going to flip that card over. What do you  tell him to look in the water barrel and he looked and it was wine. He had turned all their water into wine.  Everybody rejoiced except the guy running the wedding was probably like, we did need some water.  It's actually a bigger problem. I'm feeling a lot of his miracles were met with mixed.  Like, thanks. That's great, Jesus. Fuck. Like Lazarus, Lazarus had been dead for four days.  And Jesus comes to town and he says, Lazarus rise and Lazarus comes out of the tomb.  And Lazarus's wife is like, are you fucking kidding me right now?  But so here's a story that I want you to, I want to read to you. This story, I've never seen it in a  Jesus movie. This story is not in any movies about Jesus and it's not, I've never, I've never,  I've never until I sat and read this. I never heard this story because it's weird.  This is the story of Jesus cursing of fig tree. Is anybody by plus, no of this story?  Okay, that's just enough to make it clear. This is true. I mean, it's not an unstrue in here.  But I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. I don't fucking know. What do I know? I wasn't there.  I'm just trying to make it clear that I didn't make it up.  They do. Anyway, all right, I don't know.  Okay, here's the story.  This is Mark chapter 11.  It's when Mark went broke.  Okay.  And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and when he had looked around about and seen all things and the  even tide was come, he went out onto Bethany with the 12. Bethany was like a, like a suburb of  Jerusalem. So he went into Jerusalem and he saw the shit downtown. He don't stay downtown.  You go to the Mary out by the airport. That's what Bethany was.  Okay. And on the morrow, when they come from Bethany, Jesus was hungry and seeing a fig tree  afar off having leaves, he came to it. If happily, he might find anything there on.  But when he came to the tree, he found nothing but leaves. For the time of figs was not yet.  And Jesus answered and sayeth unto the tree, no man shall eat fruit of the  hereafter and forever.  And the disciples heard it.  And in the morning, when they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and dead.  And Peter calling to remember and sayeth unto him master, behold the fig tree, which thou  dust, Carthus has withered away and died. And Jesus answered and sayeth unto them,  have faith in God. What the fuck kind of a Jesus story is that?  And Jesus, you kill the tree. That's right mother fucker.  What's the fucking point to this story? What is the moral?  The Jesus just killed a tree. He was hungry. He was fucking cranky.  He was like, there's no fig fuck you tree. You're fucking dead. You piece of shit. I want it off.  Three. You're fucking dead. Watch this.  And the tree's like, but the time of figs is not yet. I just, it's just, again I need another week.  You want fruit out of season. Go to Whole Foods. You fucking Jew. I didn't do anything.  You can't act like that man. You can't act like that. You walk right in acting like that. Folks will  nail you to a cross. That's what they'll do. They will. You got to fucking cool at Jesus.  He got a little, you know. That's really what happened. Got a little shitty.  A little big, you know. He went to Jerusalem. That's a big town for a boy from Galilee.  And he didn't just walk in as Jerusalem. He walked in and his friends were like,  King of Jews, y'all. King at Amada, fucking Jews. The Jews didn't like that.  The Jews are like, not my president, whatever you know.  So they mailed a new cross. This is what they did. And this still weird to think to me about Catholicism  and all Christianity is this image. This image is the image of the biggest, most powerful  religion, the cleanest religion. And it's a fucking dead guy with nails just, uh, blood.  And it's in every polite room in the world. Every nice quiet place is a fucking Jesus.  And the president and his wife and they were pearls. And then we always go to look at the fucking, let's just  weird. Because it promotes nicely ideas like honor thy mother and thy father. Because they  is just McCaw.  But I love it. I love the image. I love it.  I was raised Catholic. My whole life. I love this image. I stare at it.  Every time I go by a church, if it's open, I go in because I want to see their Jesus.  They all have different Jesus. They're a little different. Some of them he's really suffering.  And some of them he's just like, oh, well, I really got myself in a noodle this time, boy.  Some of them have just to cross. Like, oh, fuck, where do you go?  Jesus got away.  But they're all different. I was in a Korean church and I saw Korean Jesus. They had a Korean Jesus with this.  Don't get mad. How else would I know?  It's just what? Korean Jesus.  Whatever. Whatever.  Jesus looks different. Mostly Jesus has blonde hair and blue eyes, which we know he didn't have, but that's  who won everything so they get to draw him. The truth is Jesus was black, but you don't see that often,  black Jesus. Hey, man, give me to fuck that from here.  But everybody wants Jesus to look like them. So they make him, they draw him to look like them. That's what I don't  like that. He's always skinny. Jesus always railed. They're just fucking doing pilates for months getting ready for this.  It's not fair. You never see a fat Jesus. I never one time saw like just a fat Jesus.  Would like ten males in each hand.  He might have been fat. We don't know. I'll tell you what Jesus was not. His Korean.  He's no Koreans in Jerusalem in the year one.  But I was raised Catholic and I ended up walking away from that because I didn't like it.  You know why? Because they tell you you're going to hell and they tell little kids that  you're five years old and the church with all its majesty and all the buildings and the clothes.  They come to a five year old and they're like, oh, you're going to hell. Oh, yeah.  You're going right to hell and you're five and you're like, what did I do? And the church is like,  you know what you did, you piece of shit. And you're going to full hell too. There's no  kids hell. You understand? You're going to write to the show. If you're five years old,  you steal a crayon from your sister and then you lie about it. You get hit by a truck. Your room  is with Hitler. There's no difference. There's no difference. They take in a room and they're pouring hot  lead into Hitler's asshole. He's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. And then you walk in there like,  all right, step up, it's you turn. Hitler's like, oh, good luck, little fella.  Poor Hitler man. I mean, at this point, he's been down there for 75 years. He's probably nice now.  Hitler's probably nice to newcomers in hell, you know. Hi, yeah. Yeah, that's pretty bad. Yeah, yeah.  Let's say, oh, yeah, okay.  I was so scared to hell when I was a kid. I remember when I found out that gay people go to hell  according to the church and I got scared because I'm not gay, but what if God thinks I'm gay?  What if I come off a little queer to the Lord?  What if he happens to glance at me when I hit my toe and I'm like, ah, he's like, I know where you're going  to be. I mean, that's there. I don't believe that. God doesn't hate you because you're gay. God made  you gay because he hates you. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. There's no God.  But you know what I feel sorry for? What I really feel sorry for is a gay man's sperm.  Just think about that. That's a tough destiny. Being a sperm inside of a gay man, that's a hard luck.  Okay. Because if you're gay, that's great. But your sperm is not gay.  Your sperm is just excited. Like, where next fellas, here we go?  That's shit right there.  Who's shedding this chick's pussy?  Yeah.  I was thinking about my life today. I was thinking about like, when I grew up in,  I was raising an orphanage that she bought a block from my parents' house and, uh,  so joke. My father is Mexican and my, um, yes, six of you here.  My father's Mexican, my mother is dead. So, um, half dead on my mom's side.  And I'm half Mexican. A lot of people don't believe on Mexican. When I tell them on Mexican, they say stupid things.  They say things like, how can you look like that?  What do you mean how, like, I'm trying it until, like, look, I'm not Mexican?  No, I don't know. I'm not Mexican at all.  Then I get a home like who's in your?  My parents, they got divorced when I was about 10 and, uh, I have kids now and their parents are divorced also.  And, uh, I remember when we told our kids about that we're going to divorce.  If you get divorced, you should tell your children.  So, we had to do it carefully because they were five and two years old at the time. So, we had to put it  in a way that they could comprehend. So, I remember we sat them down and I said, okay, listen,  you know how you love your dog. You love your dog. Like, sometimes you give your dog food from your  plate and that's supposed to, but you do that because you love your dog. Remember the other day your  mom and I were like, don't give the dog any ham, but you did because you love your dog.  Okay, so that's why we're getting a divorce.  Because you don't listen.  And we just can't take it anymore. It's just too hard to not be listened to.  So, we're going to move to separate homes and each have you for half the week because neither of us  wants to have you all the time anymore.  Yeah, it's very sad because I love your mother very, very much. And she loves me so much.  But we hate you more.  That's how we handled it. You do your best, you know?  It's all you can do with your kids. Do your best. How do you find any other way from what?  When I was a kid, they just taught us things to try to keep us just shut the fuck up.  Our morals were just shut the fuck up.  Things like slow and steady wins the race. They taught us that slow and steady wins the race.  Really, does it win the race? You know, it beats slow and steady, fast and steady.  Kicks that shit out of slow and steady. Slow and steady beats old and retarded. That's about it.  Stop telling that to kids.  A lot of what they teach kids is just to make them polite people, you know?  Like they teach them that there's words you shouldn't use. There's bad words. Don't use the bad words.  I can't teach my kids that because I do this for a living.  But I didn't want my kids to be, you know, assholes.  So I used to tell them like, okay, look, there's no bad words. There's no bad words. All words are good, bad, nothing.  But there's some people that get upset when you use certain words. So if you're going to use those words,  look at the person first and try to guess if they're that kind of person.  Sometimes you can offend somebody when you weren't even trying to.  Like, there's certain phrases, certain statements that if you're going to say them,  you should say them without stopping in the middle. Certain things if you're going to say them,  don't clear your throat in the middle. Okay? You don't want to say things like,  there are too many black people suffering from discrimination.  We need to stop the Jews from feeling excluded.  I once fucked a baby.  And then I fucked him again.  See, when I get through that one, otherwise people get the wrong idea.  They'll think you only fucked that baby once.  But it's tricky, you know, if you're trying to teach a kid's right from wrong,  you gotta choose a side often because not everybody agrees on what's right and wrong.  So how do you know, you know, like abortions, some people think it's murder,  some people don't. I personally, I think people should get abortions, like a lot, like as many as you can.  You should try to get a lot of abortions. You know why? Because it creates jobs.  More abortions, more jobs for the doctors and the nurses and the dumpster guy.  Everybody gets a job. They have to work. How they're going to feed their kids.  If you don't kill yours, it's all, it's, you gotta think everybody.  Abortions a big topic, of course, because Roe v. Wade was overturned. Roe v. Wade, of course, we all know what this is.  This was a court case. Roe was a woman who wanted an abortion and Wade was the baby, I guess I don't know.  I'm just assuming I never found out who Wade was. Wade must have been the baby anyway.  But now that we don't have that, every state has to come up with their own law,  based on how people feel they've listened to people and see how they feel. I think most Americans feel  on average the same thing about abortion. They feel like people should be able to get abortions if they need them.  But you're not just, hey, keep it down a little bit. That's all. That's just a, just say go ahead.  But yeah, come on. Come on. You're not doing it, but they'll be like, woo, woo, like just, you know.  So we need a law that covers that that keeps it available, but limits it. Here's what I think we should do.  Let's make this law. You can get an abortion anytime anywhere, but if you get an abortion,  you have to eat it. I think that's fair. Because that'll keep it, that'll make you, hmm.  Fuck, I got to eat it. I better do it soon.  Just trying to make everybody happy, you know.  Some, some Catholics believe that contraception is murder. They think if you were a kind of,  if you stop a sperm from getting to an egg, you killed a possible baby. By that logic, I could say that any woman  that will fuck me is a murderer. I mean, tell you, it is a bunch of murdering bitches out there.  But murder is a weird law. A structure also. That's not a sentence. It didn't make any sense.  Murder should be simple, because it's a binary crime. You kill somebody you don't. They're alive  or they're dead. It's one or the other. But the laws around murder are a little murky. One person can kill  somebody get a hundred years. Somebody else gets 20. What's the difference? Here's what they  base your sentence on with murder. They base it on how you felt when you murdered them. That's  weirdly important. They say, okay, you shot them in the face. But what was up with you, man? Like what  was going on? Like, come on. I think if you murder somebody, your sentence should be based on how old  the person was that you murdered. That should matter how much of their life did you take away. Like, if you  see a three-year-old girl in the park, and you just kick her to death. It's a hypothetical, fucking grow up.  It's a hypothetical. I'm not asking you to go do that. I'm just asking you to just really imagine  kicking it through your role till she's dead.  If you kill a three-year-old, you should do a lot of time. You should do a lot of time. Unless you  just got like diabetes. You got to work it all in. But what? Where did he kill somebody who's like 98?  He's 98, and he's like in a hospice. He's not even a good 98. He's in a hospice. He's like a hospital,  but they don't try to help you. And see there's a guy who's like 98 in a hospice. He's got cancer and  AIDS and COVID. And he's like, and they just unplug them. And right then you walk in,  shoot a right enough face. You should get like five minutes for that.  I was thinking about that today. Because I'm going to see my dad next week. And my dad,  let me tell you something. My father is not in a hospice. My dad is in a facility being kept alive  for who's benefit. I don't get it. It's just he's and I just put food in and just come on.  Keep going. Like, what does he have a secret he hasn't told yet?  Because look, my mom just died. She just died. That's how it works. By the way, for you,  young people, here's how life goes. One of your parents is going to die. And the other one is just never  going to fucking die. They just will never fucking die ever. And guess what? It's not the one you wanted.  Nope. It's not the one you wish to have kept. It's not your good parents.  Somebody's got two good parents. You have a nice one and a shitty one. And then I just want to just die.  Because that's what nice people do. I'll just die. I don't want to bother everybody.  And the shitty one just hangs in there.  Why? What the fuck for the long life? You can live too long, I think. You can live too long.  Some people are 100. Get the fuck out of here. Nobody knows you.  What are you going to run into somebody? Hey!  Some people are even older. Some people are read about the oldest person in the world.  There's always an oldest person. And sometimes you read about them because the other one just died.  That's when they tell you that there's a new oldest person.  Last one I read about was 114. 114 is a teenager after a hundred.  You know what that means? He's got a kid who's like 92.  Who's like, please fucking die!  I'm just hanging around so I can have one week without you and it's.  I mean, here's the bad news. You're going to die. Here's a good news. When you get closer,  you're going to want to fucking die. It doesn't keep being good. You don't want to get to keep your life  the way it is. I'm 55. Both hands hurt. Both hands. Both my hips hurt. I'm lucky I have only one  asshole. The whole fucking body hurts. When you're like in your 30s, you don't even think about it.  You're like because here's like 30s of beginning of your life and there's the end. So like you start  like in your 30s. You're just shuffling. You don't even wear this movement. You're just  shuffling along. Hey, life is good. It's pretty good. And then it's somewhere you kind of  aware that weight down their people are falling off the edge. And then you're thinking,  then you're also in your close and you're like, oh fuck, I do that guy. I hope my God. Holy shit.  But there's signs that your time is coming to an end. They don't make my shampoo anymore.  They don't make it. Why did you stop? You're the only one. Nobody fucking cares about you.  And so I thought I'm like, I'm going to make my own. I'm going to make my own shampoo.  I'm going to look it up online. I'm going to look at the ingredients. I'm going to make my own. And I found  myself at a dinner telling a table full of people. So I decided to make my own shampoo.  That's one of those moments where you tell yourself, just don't tell folks that anything.  You don't need to say it out loud. Just do the way you're doing diets when it's possible.  Do I have a huge stain? Yeah, that's all right. It's all right. So much.  Okay. No, no, no. Who's running? Oh, okay. I thought they were coming to bring me something. There's  nothing you can do. You'd have to change my whole lifestyle for the rest of the show.  It doesn't matter. I'm fat. I'm fat. I'm fat. I'm fat. I'm fat. I'm fat. I'm fat. I might pronouns are that fat fuck.  But here's the thing. I have body dysmorphia. I think I look good. I like this. I'm fine with it.  I decided to stop exercising. That's what I decided this year. I'm just not doing anymore. I made it to 55.  If I stop exercising now, it just means I might make 75 instead of 78. It's not that big of fucking deal.  I'm just not going to do it. You know who inspired me was Trump. It's the one thing he said that I liked.  I don't know if you've heard this, but Trump believes he just believes. No, we're holding this.  But he believes that you should move as little as possible  because you have a finite amount of movements and then you just stop. He believes that.  He just what he had sounds right. He just thought it up.  And he's proving it to be true. I mean it's fucking working.  I don't like the new exercise either. I don't like the Peloton. It's a bike you ride and there's a video that  encourages you and they have that mirror that you stand there and it teaches you exercises and they have that  gun and you put in your mouth and you put in your mouth and you put in your mouth.  Now you shouldn't kill yourself.  That's what I think you should not kill yourself. That's my opinion. I don't know you ask somebody that knows you.  Well, my general feeling is you shouldn't kill yourself. You know why? Because you're going to die anyway.  You're going to die? What are you? What are you getting violent for? It's going to happen.  I wish I was dead. You will be just sit there. You don't have to do anything.  It really is the most effective argument against suicide. Is that you're going to die either way. It's also  having to be the best argument at force suicide, which is awkward. You're going to die if you don't.  Anyway, friend of mine sent me a porn the other day. Folks can just send you a pornography now.  It was a porn. It was two old men, like really old guys, really old.  And they were suck in each other's cocks. Like really suck in each other's cocks.  They were sold. I was surprised they were doing anything. But they were they were one of them sitting on  the edge of a bed and his socks have fallen. You know. I mean, the guy's on his knees on a pillow  and he's just fucking blowing that guy. Then they switched places. I watched long enough to see them switch places.  And when the second guy was done, I called my friend and said, why do you send me this?  He said, because it's amazing. And it really was, you know, it really was. I've watched it a  few times. Because it doesn't turn me on. It's inspiring. Because you're like, go fellas.  Because you worry about old guys. You know, you see an old man walking by himself with just a  grapefruit and a plastic bag, you know. And they're like, oh shit. That's horrible. Maybe he's  going to suck another guy's cock. Life might be better than you think.  It's interesting because porn used to be like you go find your thing, you know. But now it's  you go to a porn site. It's everybody's stuff. You can put in a search word to narrow it down.  Or you can look around. Find new things. I saw a fart porn one time. So fart porn. I never thought  I'd be turned on by farts. I'm not interested in farts. I'm about farts are okay. I'm farting right  now, but farting this whole time. And I didn't want to watch it because it was a fart porn. It was  because of the title. The title is what got me. The title was nice girl farts in your face.  Who's not going to watch that? Nice girl farts in your face. So I click on it and there's this girl  staying there. I'm like, she is nice. It's totally nice. It's just a nice girl standing there. Pink sweater  with little blue buttons on it. And she's looking at the camera. She says, hi. I'm so glad to see you.  I was like, wow, she made me feel good, you know. And then she turns around like she's  a little reach because I got to show you something. I bought and she's reaching up and up and up and  I was like, oh my god. I mean, it was in the title. I knew it was going to happen when I was like,  oh my god. She just farted right in my face. She seems so nice.  But the best part is when she heard reaction because I thought she would be like, that's right. I farted in your face.  But she wasn't. She was like, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I can't believe that  happened. I've never been that hard in my entire life. I was so excited.  Because I realized it's not really about the fart. It's about the shame. It's about the sexy  shame of a truly nice girl who just Thunderfarted right in your face and she regrets it.  Here's the worst part. I can't find one that good again. I can't, I can't, I've never that good.  I've been chasing the dragon on this fart porn for months. It's just always some board chick hell out.  Come on. Tighten it up. Would you a little bit?  I haven't dating recently. dating is not fun. dating is horrible. Nobody wants to date. Even if you  meet somebody and you really want to go out with them and they say, yes, you're excited in that moment.  But the day of the day, you're like, I don't want to fucking do this. I don't want to do this.  Every time I'm ringing a doorbell to pick a woman up, I'm like, I hope she's dead in there. I really do.  I hope something awful happened. I don't want to sit in a place and breathe unevenly for  three hours and just sweating where your body is folded and just aha.  You ever have a day that goes well? It's like good from the beginning. You're like, you get a little laugh at  the beginning. Hi, hi, hi, something funny and they both laugh. Feels good. You see your green  stuff. When you don't agree, you laugh about it. You're even able to be quiet a little bit while  you're eating and it's nice. Feels comfortable. And then you drop them off and you're like, I hope I see you again.  And she says, I hope so too. And you feel like this is something new in my life. This is wonderful.  Then you go home and your wife is like, where are you on that? You know, I don't want to stop it.  But I'm older now. I'm divorced tonight. I still date mostly women who are younger than me recently,  because that's who looks better. That's true. But I'm not, I don't like, I've always been with women  my age or older. I was married to a woman a year older than me for 10 years and that's always been  the way I, but there's some guys that have to be with younger women. There's cultures that believe  the man should be much older. There's religions that have like a formula, you know, like take the  man's age and subtract 10 and then whatever else you have to do to get to 12, just get to it. Just  just solve for 12. But I didn't suddenly get interested in younger women. What happened was I got  older and they got interested in me because younger women like older guys. They just do this.  The other part, nobody says, I don't do anything to get younger women. I just stand there like this  and they see me and they're like, they'll be so weird to fuck that old guy.  And then we got to blame. The older guy always gets blamed. You see an older man with a young woman  everybody's like, that guy's a pervert. No, she's a pervert. He's normal. He likes pretty women.  She likes that. The fuck is wrong with her. And they're weird. I was having sex with this woman.  And she was about 35 and we're in bed. She starts calling me daddy. I was like, please don't  young lady. Please don't do that. She said, why doesn't it make you uncomfortable when I call you daddy during  sex? Is it because you have daughters? I said, no. Makes me uncomfortable because I have a father.  And I used to call him daddy when he fucked me.  But wait, thanks for laughing at me because I got to fucked up my dad.  I was not laughing at the time because I was coming because he fucked me good. He fucked daddy,  fucked me so good. It's not his fault. I made him do it. I was such a brat. I was 10. I was like daddy,  fuck me! Poor guy. He's like, I know I'm spoiling this child, but I can't see you now.  Thank you very much for coming. I hope that you enjoy the show. Thank you for coming. Again, let's say thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.",
