  "transcript": " the All right. All right. Thank you. All right. All right. Faggot. How you doing? Sorry. I called him a Faggot. I missed that word. You know, I grew up saying that word. I mean, it never meant gay. When I was a kid, I didn't know what gay was. No, I hadn't been told that people do that. I had no fucking idea. Faggot. The mean gay. When I was a kid, you called somebody a Faggot because they're being a Faggot. You know? You know what? Just being a Faggot. You should have Faggot. And that's supposed to use those for that shut up Faggot. Didn't mean, like, I would never call a gay guy a Faggot. Let's be in a Faggot. But not because he's gay. You understand? Like, if I saw two guys blowing each other, I don't know why I'm watching them do it. But if I just have enough. I don't know. It stumbled upon a couple of fellas blowing one another on their respective pinnesea. It's a portal for penis that I invented today. Pinnesea. I would be respectful to them. I would, you know, hello, gentlemen. I've never, you know. But if one of them took the ticket of his mouth and started acting off Faggot and saying, annoying Faggot things. You know, people from Phoenix are Phoenicians or something like that. I'd be like, hey, shut up, Faggot. Faggot. Faggot. Quit being a Faggot and suck that dick. That's what I was saying to him. I don't know. I would never call somebody a mean name because they're a suck at it. Because if you can suck a dick, man, that's awesome. I respect you because I can't do it. I can't do it. I mean, I haven't tried and failed. I just put myself there in my mind. I couldn't do it because I'm afraid. That's what the only reason. But that's why if you can suck a dick, I think that that's, there's a strength in being able to do that. I believe that. I don't believe that blowing somebody comes easily to anybody. Even if it's something that you generally do, every new dick must take something out of you. There must be something you gotta do. You get yourself ready, you know. Here we go. Look everywhere. You see that fuck? ¡Mulflu mantle! No próximo Soonerrations 매뇴森團 juntos répたい Been out of tension I've heard you got your parents to become a pretty waltz to overpower the fucking shit for a centimeter. to hurt other people and then they become bad, if you come hard to you. There's words that I love that I can't use because other people use them wrong. They're hurt other people. Like the word come to is a beautiful word. To me, there's just beauty in that word. And I mean, it's definitely. It's like chocolatey and round on the end. I just like the way it sounds. And I don't use it as an answer. I'm alone in the laundry. I'm like, come on. I just like sand. I would never call a woman a con, except for my mom because she likes it for some weird reason. But it's a very misused word. It's supposed to mean vagina, which I don't think works at all. Because vagina is so sweet. They're little pretty things with little flour, pedally lips. And I hear a piccolo in my head. Every time I see a vagina. Come on, you little little little. Come on. Come on. Even vagina is too harsh for... They should be called like a... Funna, Funna, Funna. Funna, Funna. Funna, Funna. Funna. Funna. Funna. There should be a butterfly flooding around every vagina all the time. This all in the time, little butterfly. And you go to the doctor and say, well, the butterfly looks good, so we're good shape. They're colored in the butterfly. How do you look at something that? Pretty insane. That's a con. That doesn't fit at all. Maybe it was a giant vagina. It was attacking a town and throwing buses around. And knocking over telephone calls. Then you can say, somebody shoot that cup with a bazooka. LAUGHTER It's going to step on the candy store. So, Faggot, Count. Everybody has different words that offend them. Different things that they hear, that they get offended by. I, to me, the thing that defends me the most is every time that I hear the Edward. Not bigger, by the way. I mean, the Edward. Literally, whenever a white lady on CNN with nice hair says, the Edward, that's just white people getting away with saying, that's all that is. They pound away, stick, stick, stick, and word. It's bullshit, because when you say the Edward, you put the word, nigga, in the listener's head. That's what saying the word is. You say the Edward, and I go, oh, she means, nigga, you're making me say it in my head. Why don't you fucking say it instead, and take responsibility? LAUGHTER I'm gonna say the words you want to say. LAUGHTER Just say it's going to hide behind the first letter, like a faggot, just say, I don't know, I don't care. I mean, all the shit goes on in my head, I don't really, like, I thought the word, in the other day, I'm gonna tell you this story, and it wasn't racist. It wasn't a race, even connotation. Let me tell you what happened. I went to a coffee place, and it was a cool, like, a cool indie code. I don't like Starbucks anymore, because you go there, and you go, you know, you know, you don't like it, you know, you don't like it, you know, you know, you don't like it, you know, you don't like it, like a cool indie code. I don't like Starbucks anymore, because you go there, and they don't care anymore. They just press a button and some old ladies' diary that comes out and they just give it to you. LAUGHTER So I go to like a young people cool coffee place with, like, my band's playing notices on the walls, and it's called, like, the howling do whatever thing, and the dude behind the counter's got a tight t-shirt and a pony's telling me, he's like, hey, what's up, man? And I was like, hey, can I get a cap of cheese, and he's like, yeah, right on, gently, like, he's amazed that he could help me, like, oh, yeah, I got all this stuff right here, that's awesome. LAUGHTER And so he starts making my coffee, just so he works so hard, he grabbed the beans just for that one cup, and put him in the thing and tamped them with his old thing, and you click, clack, and click, and, again, that he took the milky-diff broth it, like, for, oh, like, I don't work. And then he banged it on the counter, and he was awesome and he scooped it in, and he put a little co-co-on, and he's there, you go, man. And I was just blown away, and for some reason, as I left there, the thought in my head was, that nigga made this shit out of my coffee. And he was like, he wasn't black. That's just what was in my heart for some reason. Was that nigga made this shit out of my coffee? Yeah. I don't know. I don't care. I'm all sweaty. I'm all feel good. I ate too much and masturbated too recently. You know, that kind of, you know, it's bad to, like, jerk off and run out the door, because you're running into something, oh, she knows, like, you just, you gotta, take some time alone to get a, process the shame. And I just, I can't stop it. Today, I weighed myself today. I don't know, why? I'm not using the information. It's not guiding my behavior. Why am I bothering to find out exactly how much of a piece of shit I am? I weighed myself, and I usually hover around 230, 240 today. 240, I weighed myself. I weighed myself, and I usually hover around 230, 240 today. 240, I weighed 240. 240, I weighed 240. Which is not, oh, no, it's not okay. Because there's no way, like, you know, when you go to a doctor to give you, like, a formula for how much your weight, like, a rule of thumb? I'm pretty sure it's not your age plus 200 pounds. That doesn't seem like, like, I was watching a boxing match today, and the both got, they weighed 110 pounds each. So, both of those guys still need a fat baby and a dead dog to make me. And it's really bad because I'm 40, and my doctor's like, you got to be less people. You can't be so much. And he just told me, this is bad. And he starts asking me about my eating habits. You know, like, there's habits. Like, there's a pattern. It's just chaos and awfulness. It's just desperate because he's like, how many meals and how many bowel movements a day? I'm like, I have no idea. I have no idea. It's just the boy. I'm just shit in an eating all day. I fill my body to capacity and then blow it out my ass, well, that's it. Every shit is an emergency. Does that give you some idea? Of my eating habits? And he's trying to get a handle on my, he's like, do, look, look, how soon into a meal? Do you typically feel full and stop eating? I'm like, I don't stop eating when I'm full. The meal is not over when I'm full. The meal is over when I hate myself. That's when I stop. I guess normal people eat till they're like, oh, that's, I just, that's all the nutrition I require right there. I just reached it. I will cease the intake now and convert this into useful energy throughout the day. No, every time I eat it ends with me, why the fuck did I eat it? Do you get it away? I don't want to look at that shit. Is it right here, too? It's like, mmm. I got syrup in my day, it's like, for blood. I got syrup. It's gonna be bad later. I can't take it myself. And I'm always just uncomfortable, just sweaty and just, like, this is such a bummer. It's my nightmare. It's my whole life. The best thing that ever happened to me was boxer briefs. I'm so happy about boxer briefs. It doesn't seem like a big deal to most people. But before boxer briefs, I was trapped between the two awful worlds of briefs and boxes. Briefs are for normal man with one leg here and one leg here, two totally separate legs. With a whole area between, and the briefs go up into this little valley, this little area and they come down like this, and they can just, and they can just tuck up in there and just pull them nicely. Because he's got all that air and negative space. But this is just all just mashed together. Just upsetting, stiny, red, sweaty, just, just like, this looks like a pig's ass when I'm naked. Like, even my dick is curly like the tail. This is a pig's ass. And I pull briefs on and they just, you're, and they just clap my dick and balls. Here's your balls, fat, fat, fat, for your life, sorry. And they just dig up in there with this viciously sharp cotton. Like, after a while, I have just this ward of just damp cloth, just a lot of wet cotton. Just like the size of a tennis ball, like a huge water wet cotton. And boxes were worse because they just let everything flap around and touch each other and upset each other. I need everything to be segregated down here. I need everything with stick and just get, and also when I had boxes on for some reason, I always had just water. Like, like a quarter cup of water, just swashin around my asshole all the time. Just, just, just, just water, just hovering around my asshole. To find gravity, you're like upside down glass of water, my ass. I got a manage, my, because I can't stop eating. I exercise a lot. I run five miles every other day to maintain this shit body that I have. Because the food, man, I eat like high-octane crap. Like the, the other day I got a cinema. Do you know what a cinema is? Let me explain cinabons to those of you with self-respect who just walk right by shit like that. And have no idea what it was like, me or you because the line at cinabon is not a varied group of people. It's not all kinds of folks trying out a cinabon. It's kind of like there's a skinny, grouchy, he's girl and then a little dude. It's just, and no one's happy on the cinabon line. No one's like, I love these, they can't wait. No one's excited to get one. It's all dudes like me or Fatter Santa, like, oh fuck, I'm getting a cinabon. Oh, yeah. I got a cancel all that shit. I was gonna do two because this is gonna be, Here's what a cinabon is. Let me explain to you. It's a six foot high cineman swirl cake made for one sad fat man. Even if you have a vagina, you're a man if you're eating a cinabon. It's a sticky hot bun and it comes with a little tub of jizzy hot syrup. It's hot cum. There's no way that's not hot cum. How is that not hot cum? They should call it a fat-faggot tree, just do it. Just to make us say that when we book, we'll slow us down. We don't give this shit. They're gonna give me a fat-faggot tree, please. Yeah, with a hot cum, dude. I don't care. What do you think I have in integrity? I'm buying a cinabon right now. I'm buying a cinabon at the airport that I arrived at. You understand what that's extra disgusting, right? When you're leaving, if you're at your desk, when you're at the airport, you can go like, oh, I gotta eat. I need to do food because I might be trapped in the sky forever. I should eat right now. But this is I landed the trip is over. I'm 20 minutes from my house where I got fat man as an apple and shit. And I'm sitting on my luggage just fucking eaten a cinabon with a fork and knife. It was a shitty one, too. It was old. The dude, that's the thing he was about to take it in in close. I was like, I don't know, give me that, give me that. And he didn't want to sell to me, he's like, this video, please don't bite. Don't bite, it's cool. I was like, dude, I'm eating man. That's what's gonna happen next. You decide if we're gonna be in the paper tomorrow, but that shit's going to my face. I already made the shitty decision, don't ruin it. Just give me the, give me the jizz. Oh, yes, I just drink the jizz with my eyes closed. Just 10 of us jizz. Big fat bag at that I am. I am a fat bag at. But it's the hour when you are, you know, I'm 40 now and that's, you know, I'm 40. I'm half dead, basically. 40. 40 is weird age. You guys in this point where like, you're not old enough for anybody to give a shit that you're old. Nobody's like, I helped a 40 year old guy today and it felt really good to keep something for him. Nobody spends their holidays delivering hot meals to 40 year olds. And you're not young enough for anybody that ever be proud of you or impressed. They're just like, yeah, do your job asshole. Nobody cares. That's what you're supposed to do. And the world looks at you like when you're 40, if you go to the doctor, the doc, yes, what? You don't try to fix anything anymore. They start trying to fix shit. When you get to be 40, they just go, yeah, it starts to happen. They don't care. I went to the doctor because my ankle hurt, right? Now if you're 20 and you have a bad shoulder, the doctor will weaken structure shoulder through miracles of modern science. They'll take your ear and make a shoulder out of it. It's weird. But when you're 40, they just give you no options. They don't care. I went because my ankle, like I was lipping for like a month out of nowhere. And the doctor, he brings me in. He shows me an X-ray of my ankle. He's like, yeah, your ankle is just, just worn out. I was like, what do you mean? I injured my ankle. He's like, no, it's just shitty now. He's just, see that dark area? It's all hard. And yeah, they get like that. And they're not good anymore. I was like, well, so just goodbye. Nothing is there? Nothing is. Nothing is. There's nothing. There's no, it's like an incurable shitty ankle. Is it? And he goes, well, there's things you can do. You can stretch for half hour a day. You should stretch your ankle. Like, how long will that take to fix? He's like, no, you just do that now. That's just a new thing you do until you and your shitty ankle both die. This hurts a lot. I think as well, you can take a lead. Just take a lead. You can buy it. Just take it. And you can take whatever amount. It doesn't matter. Like, don't pay attention to the dosage. Like, really? He's like, yeah, you could take 10 a day. You'd be fine. He set takes 10 a leave. Damn. I said, I hurt the less stuff like hurt your intestines. He goes, oh, yeah, I don't do some intestinal damage after a while. But you just got to weigh that again. How much you like your ankle not hurting. This is all totally true, by the way. This is exactly what I have. And at one point I was like, what if I was like an athlete or something? He goes, you're not an athlete. So, no, to whatever else you were about to say. Okay. Blake. It's hard for old people. I don't have my grandma, it's 95. She can't see how to relive. I just shut off. The last thing we went to here, she said, I can't see how to my left eye. And we're all like, oh, hey, what was Christmas like of the 40s? Maybe we're at the clock on the eye thing if we're liking you know? So I go to her doctor. He's right at the end of the whole. He's there always like 90 feet away from her. So like go to the doctor and I said, you know, she can't see how to relive. I thought he got to go. Well, she's probably got a bunch of tumors in her head. I swear to God. That's exactly what he said. I remember it because I was blown away by how none of his education he applied to this particular diagnosis. He said that she's probably got a bunch of tumors in her head. He's a doctor. He called it her head. He almost said fucking head. I swear to God, like that's what he was thinking. She probably got a bunch of tumors in her fucking head. Oh, because it's that'll kind of be dead in a way. I ain't gonna get off with my death. I think we're eye. What does she need to I see the shitty place in fucking putter because you don't love her enough? Anyway, there you got him halfway there. 40 year old guys are not good specimens either. We're not. Like I have a friend who has a lot of young girlfriends. He always goes and he goes a little to their battoo young and it's not okay. You know, he brings them around and you're like, dude, don't. Like literally a pointed her face and go, don't fuck her. That's awful. Because and she's like, eh, they're just bad, you know? But so he was gonna have sex with her one night and he said he wanted to go all night. Like he wanted to really last a long time. So he said, I'm gonna drink a lot of milk so I can have a lot of sex. He's like, who told you that that matter? And it goes, well, because you can come more if you drink milk. This guy actually thinks that like you run out of com, but if you drink milk your body goes, like, oh, dude, that's perfect. Just send that right through it. That's fine. No, we don't know what difference is going in. It's in a through. Run out of com and a pinch milk is fine. You know, it doesn't matter. Send it right through, spray it all over his cat's face, whatever he was doing. What? I'll come on my cat's face. If she's watching, she's gonna get a face full of com. She knows that by now. She knows her fall now. Come on my cat's face once, shame on me. I don't have a cat. I never had one. I mean, I would come on a cat's face. I'm not trying to take that back. I just don't have an avicat. I have a dog and I had a dog when I was a teenager. And yeah, I did once. I made my dog like cottage cheese off my balls, which is something you now can't unknown. You just know it. I did this. And I only hesitated to start this end, is only because I wasn't sure whether to say that I let my dog like cottage cheese off my balls or that I made them like cottage cheese. And really considering how much dogs love cheese. I think I made them in awkward. I couldn't refuse. I think that's probably the first way to put it. I remember it so clearly. And I remember to look on the dog's face. He was like, oh fuck dude, what's wrong with you? How are you doing this to us? Just put it on a plate. Why do I have to lick it off your goddamn balls? All right, come on. Let's do it. I'm doing it. I don't care. Look, you got to live with us. I'll be dead in two years. I'm a dog. This is your problem. Sorry, I'm being so negative. I answer, I'm a bummer. I don't know. I shouldn't be. I'm a very, you know, lucky guy. I got a lot going for me. I'm healthy, relatively young. I'm white, which thank God for that shit boy. Huge leg up. Are you kidding me? Oh, God. I love being white. I really do. Seriously, if you're not white, you're missing out because this shit is poorly good. And but let me be clear, right away. I'm not saying that white people are better. I'm saying that being white is clearly better. Who could even argue? If it was an option, I would re-up every year. Oh, yeah, I'll take away again. Absolutely. I'm enjoying that. I'm going to stick with white. Thank you. Here's how great it is to be white. I could get in a time machine and go to any time and it would be fucking awesome when I get there. That is exclusively a white privilege. Black people can't fuck with time machines. A black guy in a time machine is like, hey, I think I'm a 4-9-18. No, thank you. I don't want to go. But I can go to any time. The year two, I don't even know what's happening then. But I know when I get there, welcome. We have a table right here for you, sir. Thank you. It's not only here in the year two. I can go to any time in the past. I don't want to go to the future and find out what happens to white people because we're going to pay hard for this shit. You got to know that. We're not going to just fall from number one to two. They're going to hold us down and fuck us in the ass forever. And we totally deserve it. But for now, we... Here, if you're white and you don't admit that it's great. You're an asshole. It is great. And I'm a man. How many of the fans that could one person have? I'm a white man. You can't even hurt my feelings. What hit you really call a white man that really digs the hate cracker? Well, ruin the day. I'm going to call me a cracker. Bring me back to owning land and people. What a drive. I'm married though. That takes me down a few pegs. You know, I'm a white semi to wall greens to get toilet paper, because we were out of toilet paper because I had a front or at all. I had a front or at all. So I'm driving a wall greens was nighttime, driving and then I see a deer and fucking hate deer. I hate him because they're everywhere up there. I used to live in the city and I love deer then because I was just liberal in the city and I'd see deer and you know, you're driving your friends out to the country. And you see a deer and everybody's like, why don't you drive the car? It's just something that I look at the people of deer. Look how he looks around and just so mysterious and beautiful. God gave us a gift, everybody just to join and just to join the gift of the beautiful deer. But now I live in deer are in my fucking yard every day and they suck. They're just rats with hooves. They don't matter. They have ticks that give you wind disease and they shit everywhere and they make a noise. Did you know that? They go, they're assholes. They're shit animals. I go out every morning and throw rocks in them and I try really hard to hit them in on the head with rocks. And they don't care. They're like, oh, they don't care. I don't have a gun, but if I did, I would shoot a baby deer in a mouth and feel nothing. I wouldn't feel anything. I just go, oh, look, he's dead. That's interesting. I guess that's what happens when you shoot him in the fucking mouth. I go out of my way to kill a deer. I would happily blow 20 guys in an alley with bleeding dick so I could get AIDS and then fuck it here and kill it with my AIDS. I would do that in a second. I mean it. I mean it. So I see this deer and this is how dumb these deer. I hit him with the headlights and he does boo that whole thing. And then he won't just go, he's like, could I go, okay, if I go? I'm like, fucking go! I'm like, just go! And then I get, and I try to get away from him and then I see him and he looks me and he's like, I'm panicked. I swear to you, ran and smashed his body into my fucking car. Like, just fucking destroyed my mirror, just shattered my mirror. Broke his neck. I heard him break his own fucking neck and then he just dragged his stupid deer head into the woods. And he died. And I'm glad he's dead. I was glad right away. I got out of my car. I did a yelled into his own. I'm glad you're dead, you fucking idiot! I hope your deer wife finds you dead and dies of a broken heart. Hope your deer baby starts to death. You broke my mirror. Bag is coming, nigga deer. So I go to Walgreens. I got a bite of drugs all the time because I got kids. Kids are like buckets of disease that live in your house. And you get sick from them all the time. I got sick last week I had a flu that I caught because my daughter caught into my mouth. And I got sick from them all the time. I got sick last week I had a flu that I caught because my daughter caught into my mouth. Just hit me right in the back of the throat. Like that, it's honey. I'm sick right now. I can feel it already. She did this by the way because she's trying to tell me a secret. And she thinks you tell secrets into people's mouths. She takes her whole face. Which is in considerate borderline retarder behavior. Yes, man. And by the way, she's five. Five years old. What secret does she have? That I really need to hear. Like she's going to tell me secret and I'm going to go, Holy shit, are you serious? Oh my god. Honey, I won't tell anybody that. That is fucked up. Seriously? She got an abortion on Christmas Eve. Oh my god. She's five. Five years old. You know what that means? Nothing that she says matters. She's never said anything actually important in her entire life. I literally put a miss everywhere this fucking kid is ever said. And nothing would be different. Everything would have been exactly this same. I enjoy the things she says. They're beautiful and poetic. I love hearing them. But I don't have to have a fucking hear. And that's an important distinction of your parent. You just start making it because you can't listen to them all the time. They're talking all the time. And they just talk whenever. They don't give a shit. What you're doing or if it's a good time. I'm going to shoot out with a cops. And she's telling me all kinds of shit. She doesn't care because they're self-absorbed people. They have no ability. No five year old ever goes like, No, go ahead and finish. I'll tell you after it's fine. They just can't. And sometimes it's impossible. I like that I was in New York City with my kids. I got two of these fucking things. Remember that please, children. And I'm wearing the crowded streets. I got this one here, the two-year-old. She can walk but she won't. She's a bullshitter. So I'm carrying her. And she weighs like 20 babies this kid. I don't, she's tiny but she's got the density of a dying son. I don't understand how she's this heavy. It feels like a fat raccoon holding a bowling ball. That's what she feels like. And the pain in my shoulder is intense. And it's sending signals to my brain. You don't leverage his draw, but it doesn't matter. So I'm fighting that on this side. I got the five-year-old like this. I hope it's her. I haven't looked back in about an hour. I'm just dragging somebody tiny just through many stranger to five. Briefcase corners are hitting in the temple. I don't give it shit. I'm at her neck because my pocket's vibrating. My wife's calling to see where I am. Even though she's sending to do this shit. And I'm yelling to my pocket like she can hear me. I'm fucking good. And this one is talking the whole time. The whole time with a tiny voice, two feet off the ground. What am I going to listen to this shit really? What am I going to take a knee every two seconds? Was that sweetie? Go ahead. What's that? Excuse me, sir. Go ahead. It's fine. Yeah. Yeah, sometimes dogs are brown. That's very true. It's good thing that in Missany and that shit coming out of your stupid face. Kind of a father would I be if I pretended to listen to that. I'm out of the first time my daughter said a whole sentence. That was a big deal because she had never made a whole flat by herself. She just said the little words. I was doing the dishes and behind me. I just hear she just goes, Daddy, I don't like chicken. I dropped my plate. My wife and I cried and hugged. A big moment. A week later, I'm making dinner. She goes, Daddy, I don't like chicken. We're fucking having chicken. What are you talking about? I don't like you. I don't like you. I don't like you. I like people that make me work and don't appreciate what I make for them. You don't like chicken to make whatever the fuck you want them. Get out of your shitty little plastic chair and make her on dinner. Whatever it is you want so much. You like the chicken when I shove it up your ass. That's where it's going if you don't eat it. Seriously. I will grind it up in the queason art and then blow it up your ass with a straw. I got a feeder. She's got eats. When you're kid won't eat, you just go crazy because you have a physical need to feed them. You just eat it. You just eat it. You'll die. You eat it in the food. And I like it. It doesn't matter. Put it in your face. They have your footprint in the hospital. They know that I have you. You don't have a security number. You're on the grid mother. You're skinny. I go to jail. I love my kids and I die for them. But my life is fucking stinks. It just does. What it is when you're a parent. You don't know if you don't know if you're a parent. You can't sleep. You don't sleep. You don't eat. You don't eat meals. You just eat at the sink fast standing up. Some macaroni and cheese that she didn't fucking eat. That's your dinner now. You don't do anything fun. Your single friends like did you see that movie? No, I didn't see the fucking movie. You can't even enjoy being a parent because there's no pride in it because we suck at it. Everybody suck. We make huge mistakes. You just go, whoops. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. My five year old has all these twitches and weird fears. I'm like, good luck with that shit. That's all my hand you work. Sorry. And it gets harder too. You think it's going to get easier. Like when they're babies. You think that's the hard part. You got to do everything. You got to put their clothes on. You're going to grow up and be able to. But they fucking won't do it. So it's actually easier when they're babies because when they when you want them to eat, just take food and just shove it in their face. You got to put on a shoe. You just take a foot and shoe on it. Pull her arms through the sweater. Throw her in the car and keep the door closed. And then you get the parents live for the tiny vacations from their kids. When you put your kids in the car and you close their door and that little walk around to your own door, it's like a carnival cruise. It's just a great. And you just said you're doing like, okay, well, that was bad. Well, that shit was what did I say? Fuck, that was bad. Okay, everybody. I was changing my daughter the other day and she's too old for diapers now. But she's still in them and it's bad because this kid does not poop. This kid cracks. This is not okay anymore. I was changing her type of the other day. It was like a 48 year old alcoholic man's shit in her diaper. Like she was out all night drinking the egg her. She went to denies and got a grand slam. And she didn't even have a fucking hang of her. I ate half of it, got in the fight and the parking line, passed out in the money I can shitter myself. Her friend drove her home with a windows open and dumped her on my lawn. And now I gotta clean it. And it's crazy. And you can't even react. You can't go like, what the fuck. That's disgusting. You'll fucking up about their own shit. You open our diaper. It's just chaos there. It's just bananas. It's just I every new every shit Amazing me. I'm never used to it. Everyone I'm like, okay. Wow. That is what is that? You have been eating diarrhea for a week. I think that's awful And but you can't you gotta be like you know you just go oh What? Wow you're really guessing there. That's really something. That's really okay Well, alright, let me scrape that off your knees for you You're just down off your back Get all this hazmat in one place Wait, be down Clean your tiny vagina at the end Who knew that that was gonna be my life. I had no idea That my relationship to the vagina was gonna be clean and shit out of a tiny one several times a day They don't tell you that When you're getting ready to be a dad no one in both the insides of you know You have to clean the vagina a lot because every time she takes a shit it goes straight up or twice They don't tell you that Nobody tells you And they should it's a big part of being a dad. It's big and imprisonment happens every day You gotta get it right front to back. It's very important I'm With how I got girls though girls are great. I don't want to clean shit off with some kids balls. I'm glad that's not my job I don't boys feel weird about them I got have nephews they come over and they play in the sprinkler naked with their little red dicks and I just don't like their little penis His body me I don't know I just get this weird feeling like they're gonna come over and fuck my nose or something with their little bitch I know it's an irrational fear, but it's very real to me You're gonna fall asleep in a lunch here wake up To the Control your kids could you they're fucking my nose while I'm sleeping Boys are hard to raise man. I have all my sisters have boys and I just feel for him because It's really hard and they really do's here's the thing though girls are just as hard to raise But on a whole of the level they just they're different Here's a difference to me between boys and girls boys fuck things up Girls are fucked up That's the difference Boys just do damage to your house that you could measure in dollars like a hurricane Girls like leave scars in your psyche that you find later Like a genocide or in a tracity Like my sister locked him over once with her little boy He's like four years old and she comes over and she's just she's been with him all day So she's bad shape She's got a drink because she's like I can't do it I can't do it again And I put like an RV blanket around her trying to calm her down And then her little boy walks after he's got a handful of sand. I don't know where he got it. There's no sand on my home He's got a handful of it walks up to his mom. I just throws it right under drink It's all she had And he's just ruined it Really confident too not like this. He was like guess where that shit goes right there And I was blown away by this because I have girls they would never dream of doing that It wouldn't even enter their heads that a person could do that, but they're fucked up Like my five year old the other day she went over to always broke and she demanded that I break her sister's toy To make it fair And I did That's how much shit she gave me. I broke his little toy and I felt awful. I was like crying and I look at her She's got this creepy smile on her That's it that's a difference between boys and girls and it becomes the difference between men and women really because a man will like steal your car or burn your house down or beat the shit out of you But a woman will ruin your fucking life Do you see the difference like a man will cut your arm off and throw it in a river But he'll leave you as a human being intact He won't fuck with who you are Women are non-violence, but they will shit inside of your heart My wife and I we've been we've been married for about nine years now, so we're almost done and And After nine years or two kids you start looking at me like no Just keep doing this. Oh do that We went to therapy for a while and the therapist was like heat one day. He goes, you should go on a date And I'm like fuck you. I'm not going I did go on a date with my wife and I don't think I'm gonna call her again What a really fun Some things do get easier as you've been married for a while you start to understand each other better And you start looking at yourself more you spend a lot of your marriage looking at the other person and trying to change your Or figure them out and start realizing what you're bringing to the table and you're playing them less for shit You know like my wife will never fuck me again. I know that now But I just feel differently about it. I used to get mad. He's got she's in fuck me a month How could she do that to me? Now I look at myself and I'm like how did she fuck me for years? She fucked me for years She couldn't possibly have enjoyed most of those bucks Which means she took about five hundred for the team you got to respect that shit Because I'm gonna because it's I think it's hard for women to have sex if they don't feel like it It's not a skillet they have generally men have it That's just different different sexual skills men can fuck whatever we don't care will fuck you when if we don't like you everybody knows that Will fuck you even if we don't feel like fucking you Even if we're not hard all fuck you give me so I can find away. We don't care Things We'll fuck it a rusty keyhole nail to a dime. He's ass. We don't give his shit We are just on demand we just have no we don't care Women have another skill which is that they can decide whether or not to have sex with their minds Which is amazing to me? Well, I can decide not to fuck in the middle of fucking And it's so weird to me that they can just stop because of some other shit that distracted them If I'm fucking you you could show me a picture of you cut my mom's head off And I'll be like whoa Hmm So does like come we're gonna have a talk about that That's really Because I need to come I need to to coming is a need I came the first time when I was 12 and I haven't skipped a day I come every day and I've fucked maybe 20 times in my life so It's just been me doing most of the work and I really you know I jerk off way too much and it's upsets me I don't know why Maybe it's because it's so selfish. I don't know what it is but I know it's bad I don't hurt somebody somewhere There's something wrong with like I was thinking of the day that you couldn't figure out how bad a person you are by how soon after September 11th You masturbated like how long you waited And for me it was between the two buildings going down so I have a feeling I Had to do it. I had to do it. I had to. Otherwise they went and that's the way I was doing it at the time It was a little strange time. Well, I Know you all waited a whole week because you're awesome, but I just couldn't do it A bonus or boner. It's gotta go something's gonna happen Boners just they ruin everything and I really hate boners. I hate everyone I've ever had I remember the first time I was nine that's the worst thing about a little boy's life is that you start getting boners when you're nine And you don't come for three fucking years It's three years of just vicious little boners They don't go away you just pass out moaning and a bit somewhere And you wake up you're so hard It's awful if you ever see a nine-year-old boy on the street just give me twenty bucks because he's very unhappy Or it's like his dick. I don't know if you feel like you're gonna help him out I remember that man. I remember being nine and just being hard and not knowing why Or what to do I just would rub my dick against stuff that's all I did everything I if I was sitting in front of a car I was just press it against the car Sworn from the sun. It's good I Surrun home from school after school so I could fuck my whole house basically I would just fuck the house I'd fuck the walls and the floor if you have a nine-year-old at home he's fucking your house right now Because that's what we do. I just fucking we had a quarter-way couch that counts my bitch. I fucking all day Just pumping with no results just frustrated I still weird things with my dick too like I closed it in the refrigerator door. I don't know why I just like The pressure I like that one side was metal and the other was at a quarry and like rubber with a magnet in it I just The cold air on my balls It's good, it's good, it's not in a way it's good I don't know how I ever got laid really because I was all whole at it. I still am I never understood like There's guys that just have this confidence and they can like go out with a girl no one to lean in and kiss her and she I just I couldn't I would just go could I fuck you like I just I remember when I was with a girl I was like 20 years old. I was already doing standup and I did a show in Washington DC And after the show one of the waitresses came back to my hotel She was really cute and we're making out in my hotel and she's into which she's like humping me So I start putting my hand up her shirt and she stops me My okay, so then we're making out more and I start putting my hand around and she stops me So after while she went home nothing happened and then the next night I started the club and she goes Hey, what happened last night? I was like what? And she goes how come we didn't have sex? I was like because you didn't want to she's like yes, I did I was really into it I was like why did you keep stopping me? And she goes because I wanted you to just go for it I was like what does that mean? She says I'm kind of weird I get turned on when a guy just gets frustrated and just hold me down and fucks me Like that's a big turn on That's like well you should have told me I would have happily done that for you And she says no it has to feel real and dangerous like what do you out of your fucking mind? You think I'm just gonna rape you on the off chance that hopefully you're into that shit I Man, he didn't kind of rapey vibe from this girl I suspect she might enjoy being raped maybe that's her thing I don't want to ask person ruin it so I'm just take a shot and rave her with that hell What's the worst look at happened after all She's But Anyway, that's all history sex for me. It's gone It's just me and my wife and it's sad because my wife is beautiful I love to look at her and I feel for she's gorgeous She really is she's she just turned 40 and she looks awesome and it's not because she looks young And then 40 she looks 40 on the nose, but I liked that I didn't know I would but I find it really sexy. I like that I like women women it's a huge turn on She's got she's she's got great streaks over here and I find that sexy. I really do she's she's got strong arms from picking up the kids She's strong and sexy on a whole other level, you know, she's changing she smells different She used to blue eyes there black now she's like It intense I'm kind of crazy looking you know All these lines in her face. I'll just shit. I did to her you know, she's kind of character She looks like one of those pictures from the depression of the dust bowl farmers She's intense. I like it. It turns me on. That's what I like now. I like women women women, you know girls I'm done long time ago. 22 year old girls got blessed you go do a shot whatever the fuck you do You're time That's not me anymore I like women and I know that that's offensive to 22 year old girls. I don't want man. I'm saying to I don't want I study women's affairs and I want Not to me sorry to me. You're not a woman till you had a couple of kids and your life is in the toilet That's really When you become a woman is when people come out of your vagina and step on your dreams You're still standing after that shit you are a woman If you're still going to clubs you have a pony tail dress you're standing outside of a club Waiting again in it's two degrees you got no jackets little dread going to be great in there. You're a girl I want to give you a sweater to ride home. I don't want to fight. I'll jerk off you, but I want to fuck you and get it all I do want to fuck you but you won't fuck me so fucking anyway I would I'll totally fuck you but This is the difference between girls and women and it's not about age like that's this There's a reason why they call it girls gone wild You notice there's no women gone wild because no one would fucking buy the wild women DVD Because when girls go wild they show their tits to people when women go wild they kill men And drown their kids in a tub that's what the wild women do They don't show their tits to nobody They fuck with their bras on the whole other thing Try taking your four-year-old wife's picture when she comes out of the shower fuck you get the fuck out of here It's not funny she's that you thought it would be cute like don't she's like fuck off Sorry Because she doesn't have tits anymore. She has breasts They need to be checked and maintained I get bills for my wife's breasts that's some grown-up woman shit right there Girls have the tays with a little perky nipples and that's awesome But you're not a woman to you got long chewed up nipples You're not a man to you suck one of those fucking big theater by the way Thank you very much for the hot guy good time Thank you You You",
